#The Problem Set

As a learning community, P2PU is part of a larger ecosystem of online education with different 
trends, economic models and approaches to recognition and measurement. From where we sit, 
assessment is the biggest hurdle to innovation in how people learn. It is designed around the 
way learning was structured in the past. Every learner was expected to master the same body of 
knowledge, going at the same speed, using the same learning resources and approaches.

The web has changed the way we learn. The way we recognize learning hasn’t.

Online, we are distributed, and so are our curiosities and interests. There is no “one size fits
 all” model of the internet. The web calls us to participate in a way that makes us uniquely 
 equal. Sparks of interaction, conversations, moments of feedback on the web are truly 
 peer-to-peer, and assessment on the web needs to reflect this shift.
 
#The Landscape

If you look around the web, this is already happening: communities are coming up with their own 
mechanisms for feedback and recognition.

Both [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) rally responses 
around a problem or a question. Someone may ask “How does Google Maps pinpoint my location using 
HTML5?” and members from the community provide answers. The community votes the replies of users 
“Up” or “Down” based on how helpful or accurate the reply is until a problem is “Answered.” Users
 receive “credit” for their investment in a correct answer—a status they can (and do) outwardly 
 share.
 
Other communities like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) 
recognize projects by how often they are forked or remixed by other members. In these technical 
communities, creating projects that other people can build on is a measure of expertise and status.

#A New Way to Look at Learning

Participating is learning. By observing and chiming in with your ideas in an online community, 
over time you’re learning several things: the domain of the community (i.e. code, techno, 
lolzcatz), and how to communicate within it (i.e. communication tools, but also etiquette, 
are emotiji appropriate?). An online presence is a blend of “soft” and “hard” skills, 
and they are interconnected.

Communities decide what’s acceptable. Voting an answer up-or-down, liking a post, 
or remixing a project--these are different levels of granularity, but anyone in the community can
 give feedback on any project. The community decides what’s good and what’s not, 
 and folks who make stellar contributions are celebrated.
 
Feedback is key. It’s actually a core skill in a community of practice. Whether it’s leaving a 
comment on a post, suggestions on a project, or answering an open question, 
giving feedback is a way to apply the norms and values of a community. Giving feedback is also a
 kind of learning--in and of itself.
 
#Our Conception of the Solution Set
We know that the web affects learning. We don’t know how this is all going to play out, 
but we are going to spend the next few weeks rethinking assessment on the web. This is an open 
conversation-as an organization, we have an opinion about social learning and recognition-but we
 still have more questions than answers.
