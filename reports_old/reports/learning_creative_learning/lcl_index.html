					Many Universities have experimented with MOOCs as a way of delivering content to large groups.
					But what happens when a grad school course is opened up for free online, with a deliberately non-MOOC
					structure?
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				Learning Creative Learning is a graduate course on learning technologies that has
				been running in the MIT Media Lab for several years. Taught by Mitch Resnick, head 
				of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group, it’s traditionally been targeted primarily
				at a small group of students from the MIT Media Lab and Harvard Graduate School
				of Education. The course runs over 11 weeks, and covers topics such as Social
				Creativity, Motivation and Persistence, and Constructionism and Making.
			</p>

			<p>
				In February 2013, P2PU and the team at the Lifelong Kindergarten decided to
				conduct a giant experiment - we wanted to tinker with the MOOC model, and see if
				it was possible to still learn in a socially connected way, and work on smaller
				projects within a large online course, rather than passively absorb lectures.
				Might we be able, we asked ourselves, to transfer the small, intimate,
				interactive experience online, and preserve it even if thousands or tens of
				thousands of people signed up? So we decided to run Learning Creative Learning
				online, at the same time as it ran in the classroom. We made sure it was free,
				easy to access, and invited the world to sign up.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="span6">
			<p>
				One thing everyone realised fairly early on was that there was no blueprint for
				how to do this. While many institutions have opened up their courseware, or run
				MOOCs, nobody had tried to integrate an online and offline community in quite
				the same way, or designed the courses with the objective of facilitating
				personal interaction. The first question was how to adapt the content, which
				is usually designed to be taught as a small seminar and project-based course
				with 15-25 students. Without a clear idea of who would be signing up
				(teachers? students? technologists? firefighters?) the final decision was to
				adapt how materials were presented, and how interaction was encouraged, rather
				than re-creating content. In order to keep access as easy as possible, and keep
				development costs down, the course didn’t have custom platforms or portals,
				but used open source software and tools that are freely available on the web.

			<p>Even before the course was launched, the organisers had a notion of the type  
			   of community they thought might sign up. “We interact with a lot of really 
			   interesting people in very light [ie: minimal] ways - and don't have the 
			   time to interact with them a lot. But we’re pretty sure great things could 
			   happen if they could interact with each other,” explains Mitch. ”It became
			   clearer as we went on that one of the things the course was doing was gathering 
			   like-minded people who had shared interests and letting them interact with each other.”
			</p>

			<p>The mass-nature of a MOOC means that content which might be meaningful in a
			   face-to-face context may not resonate in the same way online.
			   So we made sure to ask participants to respond to questions like
			   “What is one thing you were interested in as a child" to help online
			   participants to immediately establish personally meaningful connections -
			   a learning method which is part of the Lifelong Kindergarten learning
			   approach, which was being implemented in the face-to-face course as well.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="span6">
			<p>
				Each week online and offline participants were asked to work on an activity that
				introduced the topic of the week.
				Weekly seminars which were taking place in the face-to-face course,
				were opened up as hour-long video seminars, which allowed online participants
				to join in real-time, and online students were able to use a backchannel
				chat tool so that they could talk to each other during the seminars.
				This allowed for conversations that often probed into the subject more
				deeply and occasionally participants found that the conversations with
				one another were more interesting than the seminars themselves.

				While many MOOC projects spend a great deal of time and money developing new
				platforms, we preferred to avoid this, and rather made use of tools that
				are freely available on the web. One which we decided to experiment with
				was Google Plus. We created a Google Plus community, which allowed online
				participants to have a space to talk to each other and share what they were
				working on, and encouraged them to form smaller groups within that. It turns out
				people like big communities, but they also like smaller groups - where they get
				to know each other more deeply. More than 450 groups formed, some based around
				location, others based around interests. This approach wasn’t just a useful way
				of organising materials and people - by creating smaller groups, the learning
				experiences were instantly more meaningful to a large number of people.
				“Having people applying everything to themselves right away and going out and
				trying something each week was useful,” explains Natalie Rusk, Research Specialist 
				in the Lifelong Kindergarten Group and a co-organiser of the course. “That's why I liked
				going back and checking the G+community because you got to see people uploading
				pictures and saying ‘I tried this with these people and here are the results’”

			<p>
<div class="photo-wrap border-yellow">
				<img src="img/LCL_Gplus.jpg">
				<span class="photo-author">The main G+ community</span>
</div>

				Google platform also allowed for a successful transfer of the Media Lab’s
				individual-oriented style of learning, onto the Web, while not having to worry
				about the potential risks of scale. By creating smaller communities online, the
				course was able to mitigate the lost-in-a-crowd scenario that arises in many MOOCs.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span6">
			<p>
				“We weren't that interested in scale - we designed for connections and
				generosity,” says Philipp Schmidt, co-funder of P2PU and a Director’s Fellow at the Media Lab. 
				“The fact that 25,000 people signed up was great, but the numbers can be distracting.”
			</p>

			<p>
				While scale may not have been a design objective of the organisers,
				it was something that influenced the way the course evolved.
				Although the course was designed in a way that maximised connections and
				generosity in interactions, when we realised that signups were heading into
				the thousands (ultimately, over 25,000 people signed up for the course),
				rather than the hundreds, as anticipated, we also realised that our
				expectations of how the course would work would have to change.
				“At a certain point I realised that there was no way we could be the
				facilitators for that many people,” says Mitch. Rather than telling groups
				which tools to use, or suggesting how to assign moderators, we let things
				emerge. “I had to let go at a certain point and then I really understood what
				peer-to-peer learning was,” says Natalie. “I realised that
				my role was about highlighting the people who were doing the creating.”

				The impact of this community was felt particularly strongly during the week after the

				and on campus were high. But we were surprised by the support messages from
				the online community - it had evolved from being a course to a community of people
				who took an interest, not only in each others' learning, but in each others' lives.

				Right from the outset, the organiser’s mantra was:</p>
			<blockquote>
				This is an experiment, and we invite everyone to experiment with us and make it work!
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				By framing the course as a prototype, rather than a final product, we were able to manage
				our own expectations as well as those of the participants. Anxieties around how
				to facilitate or interact with so many people were quickly put to rest when
				many of the participants told us that the experimental aspect was their
				favourite part of the experience.


		</div>
		<div class="span6">
			<p>
				Framing the course as an experiment didn’t mean, however, that careful
				planning work didn’t go into the lead-up. “We had lots of conversations which
				teased out the anxieties we had,” Philipp explains. “The things that I felt
				excited about, like how to get it big, how to get diverse people involved and
				how to hand over some control, meant that we had to figure out what kinds of
				things we wanted to be careful with, so that we weren’t just throwing open the
				doors and letting chaos happen.” Letting people know right from the outset that
				we didn’t have all the answers in advance meant that whenever technical
				hitches came up, as they invariably did, participants responded to each other
				by saying "Remember, they said from the start that this was a prototype" which
				allowed the community to have a sense of ownership over the experiment,
				its successes and its failures.

				Learning Creative Learning was an experiment in transferring the experience of a small
				university course into an massive, open, online experience. However, we learned
				many lessons that might be of interest to others looking to transfer an existing 
				course into an online environment. 
				In every experiment, some results are more immediately clear than others. 
				In Learning Creative Learning, managing the question of transfer, or how something learnt in one
				context can be used in another, was a challenge - just as it is in face-to-face
				learning. Current research on the subject shows that transfer happens most
				often if people are explicitly engaged in thinking about the transfer while
				they learn. In order to facilitate this, at the beginning of each of the video
				sessions, online participants were asked to share what they had come up with in
				the previous week, which allowed people to show how they were transferring
				their learning, but also encouraged interactivity within the group. There was a
				lot of discussion about taking risks, experimenting, failure and motivation and
				many of the participants reported back that these conversations helped them to
				rethink their classes, or projects they were doing themselves as teachers.

			<p>
				Unlike many online courses, Learning Creative Learning was designed to allow
				people to finish with a portfolio of work, rather than a certificate of
				completion. Portfolios offer more nuanced and in-depth presentations of learning.
				But in many ways, it was the unexpected results that made the course rewarding
				for the organisers and the participants alike. At education conferences
				throughout the year, people have been meeting up face-to-face as a result of the
				course, and these lasting relationships defy the MOOC model. The post-course
				activity has also been surprising. Italian participants organised a makers fair,
				and the Google Plus community is still active. For many teachers, working in
				environments where budgets are being cut and innovation is discouraged,
				the community is not simply community for the sake of it, but also about holding
				on to their vision of what is possible in education, and sharing their struggles
				with others.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span6">
			<p>
				Making the case for a different, more participatory type of online learning, particularly within
				elite institutions who see their role, in part, as showing the rest of the world how best to do things
				of the world" can be difficult. But this course has shown that there is value in
				opening up, engaging with communities and learning from them.

				The course will run again in the Spring semester of 2014, and we’re already thinking
				about how to make improvements. The live video sessions were stressful for us because 
				we had to make sure the technology was working (there is no margin of error when 
				things are live) and for the speakers it was difficult to have an engaged conversation 
				with each other, while trying to keeping an eye on feedback from the online community 
				at the same time.
				We’re already working on new technology which will allow us to mitigate this. 
				The plan is also to allow participants to self-organise a little more, 
				and form their own groups using a variety of tools.
			</p>

			<p>
				As a proof-of-concept, Learning Creative Learning did what it set out to, proving that
				university-level, seminar-style courses can be opened up and taught face-to-face and online
				simultaneously. But more than that, it was an experiment in community building between online
				and offline learning communities, which, depending on one’s perspective either broke the MOOC
				model, or, as we like to think, fixed it.
