				If someone says “online course” you might think about a very passive experience, like watching lectures,
				talking multiple choice quizzes, or reading out of an e-book. At P2PU we focus on passion, play and
				projects, and we were seeing less “play” in the exercises and tutorials in the online education landscape.
				We wanted to change the conversation, to encourage creative expression and nurture originality. We
				believed we could offer a learning experience that would include mastering new skills, certainly, but do
				so as a byproduct of creative projects.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="http://playwithyourmusic.org" class="strong">Play With Your Music</a>
				is about learning music while playing with music. It’s a hands-on
				introduction to the creative processes of audio engineers and producers. The first six-week course
				provided an introduction to critical listening, strategies for learning from recordings, musical uses of
				audio effects, mixing and remixing. In November 2013, over 5,000 participants signed up to participate.
				They worked together in small “Learning Ensembles” of 30-40 people to make their own mixes and remixes,
				and shared their sounds along the way via
				<a href="http://soundcloud.com" class="">SoundCloud.com</a>.

		<div class="span6">
			<p>From the outset, the #PWYM team--Dr. Alex Ruthmann (NYU), Ethan Hein (NYU), Vanessa Gennarelli (P2PU) and
			   Dirk Uys (P2PU)-- approached the course as a design-based research project. We were interested in ways to
			   build a sense of “belonging” to a community in an online space. Our hypothesis was that small groups with
			   shared musical interests or tastes would sustain engagement, support peer learning, and prompt deeper
			   feedback. We wanted folks to feel like they had a “crew” they could depend on.
			</p>

			<p>
				We wanted to develop not just a great learning experience, but a design-driven research project to grow
				knowledge around peer-driven learning online. In this paper we reflect on the aims, the experience, and
				the lessons learned from PWYM.

				When we look back at it now, the fact that only four weeks elapsed between our kickoff meeting and
				opening for signups seems insane. In four short weeks we built a website, developed promotional
				materials, wrote a grouping script, designed the learning content and activities, shot and edited
				videos, recruited and scheduled guest speakers, drafted the assessment program, tested the tools, and
				reached out to music communities around the web.
			</p>

			<p>
				It helps if you have a common mission. #PWYM shared some common design principles that we kept in mind
				as we built each aspect of the course:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>#PWYM would be about lifelong learning for the widest possible audience.</strong>
						This content would be accessible, targeted at beginners, and playful. This meant designing
						experiences around free, browser-based creative tools that fostered sharing, collaboration and
						peer feedback. We also partnered with singer/songwriter Clara Berry and her engineer/producer
						Bradford Swanson to provide musical multitracks as interactive course content that PWYM
						participants could work with.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Design for low floors and high ceilings.</strong>
						We would make sure there were easy ways to get started and lots of possibilities to take projects
						further. We curated some of the best pre-existing online instructional videos, and created
						introductory videos modeling use of the the course's creative tools to lower the floor of entry.
						To engage the more experienced learners, we designed open-ended analysis templates and
						encouraged all participants to share their expertise through peer-feedback and contributions to
						the course resources.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Empower learners with choices.</strong>
						If they want to use Google+ or another musical engineering program--great! Each week of the
						course, participants were encouraged to apply the tools to their own favorite music (analysis)
						or creative mixes and remixes of course material. Participants were encouraged to create their
						own original piece to be shared the last week of the course on SoundCloud.com and the Google+
						group. Finally, all course content emails were posted to the PWYM blog so stragglers or
						outsiders could follow along at their own pace.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Model a reflective practice.</strong>
						Both the weekly instructional videos and live interview questions were focused on sharing one’s
						creative thinking and practice processes, with a special focus on the musical, expressive, and
						creative intentions behind their work. A reflective sharing component was built into each week's
						assignments with the directive to share one's creative works and reflections with the broader
						Google+ community.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Design for social presence.</strong>
						Give learners the feeling that they are interacting with real people, not just a pseudonym.
						Create opportunities for folks to cohere and share personal stuff from their lives. The live
						interviews also enabled a "real" connection and opportunities through group chat to ask questions.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="span6">
			<p>
				With these design principles in mind, we utilized the following structures and tools:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Mechanical MOOC: A grouping script to form small cohorts of learners to communicate via
					   email.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Google+: umbrella for the whole #PWYM community, used to post resources, questions, projects and
					   feedback.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Soundation.com: a digital audio workstation to help folks learn the basics of mixing and
					   remixing.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>SoundCloud.com: an online repository for #PWYM folks to post their masterpieces.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Unhangout: a forum for videoconference-style Q&A with our weekly guest speakers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Badges: a means for learners to assess their skills and receive feedback.</p>

				<li>
					<p>Weekly newsletters: a way to showcase exemplary projects and take a wide-angle lens on the
					   developments in the community.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>GIFs. Lots of GIFs.</p>

					Thinkers in the learning landscape are interested in developing a sense of “belonging to a learning
					community” as a means to motivate learners. 
				This is certainly a big area of interest for P2PU, and is
				reflected in many of our design principles for PWYM. If you feel as though you fit in a group and
				deserve to be there, you’ll feel positively about learning, not shy away from challenges, and reach out
				to others to help buoy you up when you need help. A sense of belonging can help overcome certain
				roadblocks for learners. Folks who feel like they don’t belong can display poor learning behaviors. They
				might not ask questions if they feel out of place, not wanting to draw attention to their outsider
				status. In the open online learning environment these challenges are particularly relevant, given we are
				often dealing with learners with no prior ties to one another, varying degrees of preparedness, and the
				ability to drop off at any time with little accountability for their absence.
			</p>

			<p>
				For #PWYM, we decided to create cohorts of 30-40 folks, grouped based on their musical taste, to create
				learning communities to which learners could feel they belonged. When learners came to
				<a href"playwithyourmusic.org">www.playwithyourmusic.org</a> to sign up, they were asked what their top 5 musical artists were. From that data,
				we used the Echonest API to form “learning ensembles” with overlapping and similar taste. A nice
				side-effect of using a tool like Echonest is the ability to collect data and visualize the communities
				we create (providing another avenue of engagement for learners). Here’s a visual of #PWYM musical tastes
				at a high level.

				<strong>
					This proved successful as a means of initial engagement: when the groups were announced, learners
					tried to “reverse engineer” the algorithm we'd developed – clearly grouping based on musical taste
					had
					piqued the interest of our community.

					As previously mentioned, we thought of #PWYM as a design-based research project. Throughout the
					course, the PWYM team met virtually to discuss feedback from participants, 
					making adjustments to content and course structure along the way. As the course wound down we began
					to crunch our datasets, including:
				</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Email engagement within groups: <br>

						number of times emails were opened, links clicked, replies to the group
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Comments in the G+ community</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Clicks on YouTube videos</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Post-course survey (110 responses - 2% response rate as compared to sign-ups; 6.7% as compared to
					   G+ group enrollment)</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				We started out with the hypotheses that our small cohorts would lead to sustained engagement. If our
				small groups enable learners to take risks and share, then their colleagues would buoy them up and help
				combat attrition (completion rates for traditional MOOCs hover around 7%). But as the course round down
				in week six, several surprising things happened.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Stragglers still learn. </strong>
				What was surprising to us was that folks continued to post projects
				several weeks after the “deadlines” had passed. In the comments, folks mentioned that they had
				watched previous learners post their projects, and were inspired by them. Others apologized for
				the late post, like these folks who posted their projects a full 2 months later.</p>

			</div>
			<p>
				<strong>
					Learners found their own crew.
				</strong>
				We noticed an interesting trend about halfway through the course. If a learner found that their cohort
				wasn’t active (or active enough) they would post their project to the wider #PWYM G+ community. From
				there, learners began to self-form into their own groups, often with folks who were at the same point in
				the learning material.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Participation is a continuum.</strong>
				While a lot has been said about MOOC retention, we found that when we
				drilled down and got more granular, folks participated at different levels, in different ways, in
				different parts of the course. While many learners accessed the core content, others gave feedback,
				posted their own projects, or commented on the G+ site. Participation isn’t “on” or “off”--there are
				many points of entry and engagement.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>How important are credentials?</strong>
				We didn’t offer certificates of completion for this course, but we did feature 4 #PWYM Badges for folks
				to submit their projects. Of the 5,000+ folks who signed up and the relatively active 1,500 folks in the
				G+ community, less than 50 learners applied for Badges. Researchers at EdX have found that most learners
				who took their courses were not interested in the assessments, and that certification is a “poor proxy
				for learning” in MOOCs (Ho 2014). Since this course was aimed at an informal audience, it’s possible
				learners did not prioritize the credentials, but instead valued the audience they gained on the G+
				community and on SoundCloud.

				<strong>
					Expertise matters.
				</strong>
				While P2PU courses empower learners to create their own content, the input of experts matters as well.
				The weekly live interviews from industry experts empowered learners to engage directly with experts and
				received high praise from the community.
			</p>
			<ul class="quotes list-type-none">
				<li>
					<p>“The live interviews were amazing.”</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“I did not expect so many quality guest speakers.”</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“Very good course material (I'm particularly grateful to Alex Case). Also, I didn't expect Brad
					   Swanson to do a Soundation mix himself and explain his process in details. You made this
					   mechanical MOOC very humane, with lots of input. And the whole approach of learning to listen
					   before mixing was very helpful. Thank you very much.”</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>The course that doesn’t end.</strong>
				In addition to our steady stream of stragglers, our post-course survey
				revealed that learners planned to keep going. Some learners liked specific tools, some were inspired to
				move their creative endeavors in a new direction, some wanted to try more advanced mixing programs. To
				wit:
			</p>
			<ul class="quotes list-type-none">
				<li>
					<p>“I learned more than I anticipated and prompted me to pursue additional online learning avenues
					   such as Lynda.com”</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“Lots of good pointers. Clearly explained instructions. Fun assignments. Love the SoundCloud and
					   am going to contribute more in there.”</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“My wife composes a lot of music, and I'm interested in producing a lot of that mixing synths and
					   live instruments to make recordings of some of those compositions.”</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“I would love to produce audio tracks to support video production work for my employer. These
					   would be things like public service announcements (I work for the San Diego County District
					   Attorney) and "feel good" videos about the work we do in the community. I'd also like to continue
					   improving my ability to produce my own recorded tracks (singer and guitarist).”</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

		</div>
		<div class="span6">

			<p>
				<strong>Expectations are high.</strong>
				The first P2PU courses were run on wikis—the open education landscape has changed
				a lot since then, and learners’ expectations for free courses are higher. Immediately after course
				launched, we found a bug that gummed up our ability to send emails from the Mechanical MOOC. Even though
				we had messaged our course as experimental, and frequently posted tech support updates, the learners
				were restless. Unfortunately this bug may have contributed to attrition early on in the course. Lesson
				here: troubleshoot, brand your experience as an “Alpha” and have a direct way for learners to file bug
				reports.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Google+ please give us your data.</strong>
				We loved using Google+. Many learners already had profiles, and they would receive timely notifications
				from the #PWYM community. However, Google doesn’t currently have an API for G+, so we were unable to
				access this engagement data. We’d love to see Google enable Community Statistics for non-profits moving
				forward. Please, Google?

					This was P2PU’s first foray into the “creative expression” space, and we learned a lot from it.
					Additionally our findings and experiences have implications for the wider MOOC and online learning
					landscape. As the EdX folks have noted, MOOCs are a different beast, and the definition of “student”
					or
					a “course” might need to be rethought in this context. We agree, and put another few terms up for
					discussion.
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Retention.</strong>
				As we could see from the stragglers and ongoing G+ activity, #PWYM’s momentum didn’t stop after the
				course officially “ended.” Latecomers paid attention to what the initial learners posted, took
				inspiration from them, and continued to work on projects in their own time. In this light, retention is
				longitudinal. Or put another way, courses are a way to introduce new people to a wider, ongoing
				community. Courses don’t need to stop, nor should they—mentors can help newbies who are
				struggling in the first weeks of the course.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>
					Assessment.
				</strong>
				<a href="http://reports.p2pu.org/reports/assessment_on_the_web/">We’ve discussed at length how we think assessment should work like the web</a>, but #PWYM added another
				dimension to the discussion. After we grouped cohorts together, learners sought expertise and
				camaraderie outside their small group. In a social learning environment, finding “your people” is a way
				of successfully navigating the community. We suggest that finding your “crew” or your cohort is a kind
				of assessment. Knowing who has the expertise you are looking for is as important as having the right
				question.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Cohorts.</strong>
				As we mentioned, we were really excited by the idea of building affinity groups when we grouped folks by
				musical taste. Our hope was that, by building small communities, we would help groups develop a feeling
				of belonging. However, that engagement, for most groups, was short-lived. Small groups may have grounded
				folks in the #PWYM community initially, but they needed a reason to build and own their culture. In the
				future, we suggest designing a balance of structure and serendipity in an online learning community.
				We’ll also be paying attention to when learners begin to use the language “we” and “our.” And six weeks
				might not be enough time for a group to gel.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Community.</strong>
				Thinking through how to bootstrap, nurture, and maintain a community is vital in a MOOC. We’re really
				proud of the feedback we received about the #PWYM community:
			</p>
			<ul class="quotes list-type-none">
				<li>
					<p>“I wasn't sure what I would really learn, but this course offered great material, in a great
					   format, with the aid of a fantastic community.”</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“I was amazed how helpful the PWYM community was to each other.”</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“i met different people of different cultures and musical tastes but had 1 thing in
					   common....music and production didn't really know what to expect in the first place”</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We seeded our community pages with sample content, modeled a reflective practice, and encouraged people
				to share their sounds with others. Especially in an online context, learning is inherently social. We
				advise future MOOCs to <i>consider how the community will interact as their first design principle.</i>
			</p>

			<p>
				We’re really pleased with the outcome of the course. If success in open learning is building a vibrant community of practice, with learners who will continue to imagine new ways to deploy the skills they've learned, then we've achieved it. We're also excited about our results and their ramifications for online learning in the future--project-based, creative, but above all rooted in community.

				#PWYM 2.0 is a nifty collaboration with renowned rock star <a href="https://petergabriel.com/latest/">Peter Gabriel</a>. Many of the core projects and experiences will be the same, however, we will be focusing on creative music and audio production skills using the music of Peter Gabriel. In addition to assisting you in analyzing and making your own music, we'll augment the class with interviews from musicians who've performed and collaborated with Peter in the past. So we believe experienced PWYM participants will have a chance to make new connections and go deeper--and help others along the way.

#PWYM 2.0 begins May 16, 2014. Sign up here: <a href="http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/">playwithyourmusic.org</a>.
