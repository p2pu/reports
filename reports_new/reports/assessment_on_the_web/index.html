            <p>
				As a learning community, P2PU is part of a larger ecosystem of online education
				with different trends, economic models and approaches to recognition and
				measurement. From where we sit, assessment is the biggest hurdle to innovation
				in how people learn. It is designed around the way learning was structured in
				the past. Every learner was expected to master the same body of knowledge,
				going at the same speed, using the same learning resources and approaches.
			</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
	        <p>The web has changed the way we learn. The way we recognize learning hasn’t.</p>

            <p>
				Online, we are distributed, and so are our curiosities and interests.
				There is no “one size fits all” model of the internet.
				The web calls us to participate in a way that makes us uniquely equal.
				Sparks of interaction, conversations, moments of feedback on the web are
				truly peer-to-peer, and assessment on the web needs to reflect this shift.

            <p>
				If you look around the web, this is already happening: communities are coming up with
				their own mechanisms for feedback and recognition.
			</p>

			<p>
				Both <a href="http://www.quora.com" target="_blank">Quora</a> and
				<a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>
				rally responses around a problem or a question. Someone may ask
				“How does Google Maps pinpoint my location using HTML5?” and members from
				the community provide answers.

        </div>
        <div class="span6">
	        <p>
		        The community votes the replies of users
				“Up” or “Down” based on how helpful or accurate the reply is until a problem
				is “Answered.” Users receive “credit” for their investment in a correct
				answer—a status they can (and do) outwardly share.
	        </p>
           <p>
				Other communities like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
				and <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> recognize
				projects by how often they are forked or remixed by other members.
				In these technical communities, creating projects that other people

				Participating is learning. By observing and chiming in with your ideas in an
				online community, over time you’re learning several things: the domain of the
				community (i.e. code, techno, lolzcatz), and how to communicate within it
				(i.e. communication tools, but also etiquette, are emotiji appropriate?).
				An online presence is a blend of “soft” and “hard” skills, and they are
				interconnected.
			</p>
	        <p>
		        Communities decide what’s acceptable. Voting an answer up-or-down, liking a post,
				or remixing a project--these are different levels of granularity, but anyone
				in the community can give feedback on any project.

            <p>
				Feedback is key. It’s actually a core skill in a community of practice.
				Whether it’s leaving a comment on a post, suggestions on a project, or
				answering an open question, giving feedback is a way to apply the norms and
				values of a community. Giving feedback is also a kind of learning--in and of

	<h2>Design Principles</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="span6">
	        <p>
				As learning on the web has evolved and “grown up”, a few innovative trends have emerged. Certain principles tap
				all the connectedness that the web has to offer. Of the learning communities we consider successful and that
				we admire, several share the following principles:
			</p>
            <ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Recognize different paths to the answer.</b> Traditional assessment structures often resemble binary code: they
						are either on (right) or off (wrong). There’s a mismatch between this kind of black-and-white approach and
						working on complex projects: solutions are often iterative, and understanding grows over time. Say you’re an
						urban planner tasked with building a new park. There are countless ways to approach the problem--you could
						optimize for greenery, for social interaction, for ecological impact--and all of the answers would be
						relevant. Real world problems often have several solutions. The way we learn and recognize learning should
						not be “one size fits all.”
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Model concepts of quality and community norms.</b> Learning communities determine what is “in” or acceptable,
						and what isn’t. Community moderators or experienced members often shine a light on what they consider to be
						of quality, for instance with “Featured Projects” or “Projects We Love” gallery. Imparting exemplary work
						with some sense of status models behavior for the wider community.
					</p>

				</li>
	        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
            <ul>
	            <li>
		            <p>
			            <b>Foster deep conversations and social presence amongst community members.</b> As mentioned <a href="http://reports.p2pu.org/reports/assessment_on_the_web/part_1/">in our previous post</a>,
						participating in a learning community is a way to master both a domain and the norms and values of a
						community. For example, say you post your latest crochet mittens to the knitting community site <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/account/login">Raverly</a>. The feedback from the community
						will: a.) make your future crochet projects more stitch-perfect and, b.) model for you how to participate in the larger Raverly community.

						If you’re stuck on a certain pattern, consulting experts on Ravelry can buoy you up, help you overcome obstacles and take risks.
		            </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Build in reflection and self-assessment.</b> In educational circles we often hear about building a “reflective
						practice”--asking learners to look back on their own work, diagnose their understanding, and imagine how
						they might use these skills in the future. In eduspeak we call this “metacognition”: thinking about your
						thinking. Which is positively correlated with lifelong learning and self-directed exploration. Which I think
						we can all agree is a good thing.
					</p>


				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Support a learner’s continued growth and evolution.</b> E-portfolios and other similar mechanisms make space to
						showcase how we evolve, and tap the wealth of resources available on the web. As learners progress they gain
						visibility within a community, and they are expected to take on increasing responsibilities, e.g. to help
						others, provide feedback, or maintain the norms of the community.
					</p>
				</li>

				As part of the open & online education community, we’ve come across scores of platforms and learning networks.
				A few of the ones we admire put in place several of the assessment principles we outlined above.
			</p>
            <p>
				<a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>,
				the playful programming environment out of the
				<a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/">Lifelong Kindgergarden Group</a> at the MIT Media
				Lab,
				hosts a vibrant online learning community for its
				“Scratchers.” To onboard new community members,
				the front
				page models what the community determines to be
				of quality--the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">”Featured Projects”</a>
				area shines a light on exemplary projects. To
				draw a path for new learners through the
				community, users pass
				through the phases of “New Scratcher” “Scratcher”
				and “Community Moderator.” There’s even a whole
				group in the
				forums to support new Scratch members.
			</p>
	        <div class="photo-wrap border-orange">
                <img src="img/scratch.png">
            </div>
	        <p>
				These labels are useful: the community understands that New Scratchers need more support and feedback to get
				off the ground. Then as learners acclimate to the culture, they are recognized as experts and become
				“Scratchers.” Each label does its part to support a sense of belonging amongst community members.
				Additionally, Scratch offers multiple ways to develop strong social ties with other Scratchers by enabling sub-communities to form around any interest. This strengthens the feeling that Scratch can be a home for the
				learner, and a place where she can find others with similar passions. Scratcher online profiles create a
				portfolio-type effect that allow you to observe the set of a learner's projects, but also projects of other
				Scratchers they liked, and active curation of projects in the community. Scratchers also frequently reflect on
				their own work, and the strategies they followed to implement certain features, in the project descriptions
				they leave for others.
			</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.instructables.com/">Instructables</a> is another popular learning community where members
				showcase their DIY projects. The learner profiles
				showcase the diversity of projects learners have
				worked
				on, forming a kind of portfolio that evolves over
				time. Like other communities on the web,
				instructables has
				forums, a question-and-answer mechanism, and groups
				that have formed around certain interests. Unlike
				other
				learning communities, the learner profiles reflect
				their individual participation in each area,
				recognizing
				their expertise and engagement in the community.
			</p>
	        <div class="photo-wrap border-green">
                <img src="img/instructables.png">
            </div>
	        <p>
				Another unique aspect about instructables is that the platform asks you to step out your creation so that
				others can replicate it. If you post a claymation Halloween mask, the platform asks you to walk through
				carving the mold, adding a mustache and glueing the googly-eyes.
			</p>

	        <div class="photo-wrap border-yellow">
                <img src="img/instructables_2.png">
            </div>

	        <p>
				Not only does this platform recognize different paths to the answer--you could probably find 20 different
				posts on making Halloween masks--the very act of walking through what you’ve made and explaining it to someone
				else is a type of self-assessment.

	<h2>Open Questions</h2>
    <!-- Example row of columns -->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="span6">
	        <p>
				While our assessment experiences touch on each of these principles, there are several nuts we have yet to
				crack. One outstanding question is how to approach expertise in an online community. We’re a bit uncomfortable with the
				term “Expert,” since it implies hierarchy, but sometimes it is crucial to get feedback from someone who has a
				lot of expertise. How do we treat those with more experience in
				an egalitarian way? And how to do make sure that we scale access to expertise - having the world’s foremost
				expert answer emails from every new member of a community simply doesn’t scale.
			</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
			<p>
				Assessment needs to be radically rethought, but it’s difficult to experiment when the stakes are high.
				Informal learning groups have the freedom to experiment--we can tinker, innovate and try out new ideas.
				However, there’s a disconnect between what is happening in informal learning spaces and how that is recognized
				in the traditional system of certification and accreditation. “Badges for Lifelong Learning” has attempted to
				bridge the gap between informal learning and legitimate recognition, but perhaps they are only one step in
				this direction. How can we make alternative assessment “count”?

    <!-- Example row of columns -->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="span6">
	        <p>
				What we’d like to suggest is an approach that great instructors already know to be true: when a student gives
				feedback or support to another student, that process deepens their own understanding. In the case of learning
				to program, students with expertise <a
					href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12828081/Assessment%20for%20the%20Web/de%20Faria%2C%20Forming%20Groups.pdf">
				actually learn <i>more</i> when they work with students who have less expertise</a>. In writing courses, the
				<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12828081/Assessment%20for%20the%20Web/1170598-Topping.pdf">
					research suggests </a> that the act of critiquing another’s work measurably improves the quality of your
				own. We
				can associate peer feedback with dozens of other skills, including communication, conflict resolution,
				negotiation,
				and empathy.
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s a bit edu-speak, but bear with us: what we mean to suggest is that you can learn through assessing
				someone else.
				That statement has massive implications, good ones, for learning communities on the web. Not only will
				communities
				come up with their own notions of quality (the software development community GitHub has “core contributors”
				as an
				example) but communities can also scale to meet the needs of many learners in a personal way.
			</p>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
			<p>
				Let that resonate for a second. <i>Scale to meet the needs of learners--in a personal way.</i>
			</p>

			<p>
				If we recognize that problems might have several answers, and feedback on your project extends your own
				learning, then every path is unique and personal. This is the promise of assessment on the web.
			</p>

			<p>
				At P2PU, we’ve experimented quite a bit with peer feedback and collaborative work. We’ve made several
				prototypes for alternative assessment, and experimented with different kinds of cohorts for learning.

						<strong>(Better) learning analytics.</strong> And by that, we don’t mean pageviews or time-on-site--those

						<a href="http://info.p2pu.org/2012/12/09/analytics-and-the-art-of-learning/"> what <i>should</i> be measured</a>. We’re interested in how communities establish their notions
						of quality, and how individuals learn how to become part of a
						community. <a href"https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> features the ability to embed comments
						within the waveform of a sound (a neat way to indicate
						quality).
						<img src="img/soundcloud.png" alt="SoundCloud screenshot" />
						Some of the things we would like to see analytics for are

						learning mindsets</a>, a set of non-cognitive skills and dispositions that turn out
						to be
						very important
						for academic success. For example, when you feel part of a
						learning community, you’re more likely to
						overcome setbacks and develop a more positive mindset towards
						academic work. We’ll be looking at analytics to see which
						variables or interactions make folks feel like they are “part

						opinions of our peers into them.

							Badges for Lifelong Learning</a> is one way to display the skills you’ve learned in a handy “backpack.”
						<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> is also attempting to curate recognition with their
						“endorsements” feature. We’re excited to see how folks put together their array of skills, and how those
						portfolios might challenge traditional accreditation.

				Accreditation is the main roadblock to innovation in assessment and the wider educational landscape.
				Credentials are often the gatekeepers to opportunity, recognition, success. Unfortunately, accreditation
				systems are extremely slow to change, often deeply hierarchical, and transcripts don’t tell us much about
				interpersonal skills or mastery. But the web can.
			</p>

			<p>
				On the web, communities come up with their own way to recognize accomplishment. Sometimes they are in line
				with traditional accreditation and sometimes they are not. These mechanisms are transparent and evolve over
				time in step with the way communities work and learn. Not surprisingly software developers were the first
				professional community to do this. They have developed standards of accomplishment and recognition that are
				built on the web. Other communities are following.

				We’ve proposed a number of “opportunities” for how assessment can evolve on the web. The tension between new
				ways to recognize learning, and the old mechanisms of accrediting learning will increase. And however accreditation
				shakes out, the web will be an important aspect of how we showcase to others what we have done, the things we
				have learned, and who we are.

                <p>The Peer 2 Peer University is a grassroots open education project that organizes learning outside of
                    institutional walls and gives learners recognition for their achievements. P2PU creates a model for
                    lifelong learning alongside traditional formal higher education. Leveraging the internet and
                    educational materials openly available online, P2PU enables high-quality low-cost education
                    opportunities.</p>
