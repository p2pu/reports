	"text": "  Introduction  Background  Logistics  Reflections  Opinions  NumbersIntroductionP2PU has always believed in experimentation, and that the results of our experiments should be shared. One of these areas of  experimentation is our work set-up - we are a totally virtual,  distributed non-profit, with staff and volunteers all over the  world.In 2012, we decided to try running a pop-up office for 1 month. This report documents the set-up, experience and evaluation of the pop-up. Distributed working is becoming increasingly popular, particularly in the non-profit and tech worlds, where staff with expertise may be located in several countries. While this model has many benefits, it also present a unique set of challenges. It is our hope that this report provides useful  guidelines for other virtual organisations who might want to run  short-term offices, and a face-to-face model for other global,  distributed communities.When planning the Berlin Office, we looked online for advice and guidelines on how to run a project like this, which we conceptualised of as part event, part conference, part residency. We struggled to find any resources which were applicable to our experience, so we created this document, as both a record of how we went about planning and running the office, and as a tool for other communities and organisations who might be grappling with the same questions.We’re not looking to influence anyone, and we’re sure that other people might take a look at how we did things and decide to do it differently. In fact, we’d be delighted to hear from anyone who has modified our process – we hope it can be a useful starting point  and would love to see where you ended up.BackgroundSince our launch in 2010, P2PU has always had at least one meeting every year where core community members and staff have been able to get together and work face-to-face for a few days.Due to time restrictions (meeting were usually held over a long weekend) we tended to focus these meetings on strategy planning and other “big” conversations about the overall direction of the  organisation. However, by 2012, we felt that changes that had  taken place in P2PU meant that we needed a different kind of meeting.From an organisational perspective, the more formalised structure that P2PU was growing into (at that point, four full and two part-time staffers) coupled with the distributed nature of our staff and core volunteers (we are spread across five continents and 9 time zones) meant that few of us had actually worked together in  the same place, at the same time, for any sustained period. Some   staffers had never met face-to-face.There was also a fair amount of staff turnover in the early months of 2012, and while this was understood by most staffers and volunteers as being expected and natural for a small non-profit working in a highly experimental environment, it also caused some feelings of unsettledness and anxiety. We felt it would be valuable to refresh and cement the ties between us - both for members of  the community and staff.Secondly, we realised that there were several projects that needed attention and input, and that these projects were too important to be managed over a few days. Platform UX design, building the prototype of the Mechanical MOOC, schools development, and developing a mentorship platform were projects that we had  wanted to work on for a while. We knew that they would benefit  from multiple eyes and opinions, which is difficult to replicate  and execute via email and over several time zones.These factors, plus the fact that we knew that the most productive time for any work on P2PU projects is when people are in the same physical space, led us to develop the idea of a pop-up office, to be held over a month in Berlin in July 2012.Location, Location, LocationBerlin has always been a favourite spot for P2PU. It is inexpensive compared to the rest of Europe, and easily accessible from just  about anywhere. P2PU has a loose network of friends in Berlin,  and other organisations like Mozilla and Soundcloud were planning  events in the city at the same time, which opened up possibilities  for collaborations.Paying for it allBased on the budgets from previous meetings in Berlin, we estimated an overall cost of U$30 000. This budget allowed us to offer some financial support to staff and volunteers in the form  of fellowships, which would cover the cost of flights and shared  accommodation in rented apartments. This, we hoped would enable a  varied group of people to the meeting, and allow people to stay  long enough to make the working time productive. It also allowed  for rental of shared working space, some food and entertainment  budget, and general office expenses. This funding was provided by  a grant from the Shuttleworth Foundation.Who to invite (and how to make that decision)We have experimented with various application methods for P2PU meetings in the past, and have never found one that we’re 100% happy with. Skin-in-the-game is the usual yardstick we use - a rough measure of commitment and involvement in either the day-to-day workings or overall direction of the project. However, this is difficult to quantify, and coupled with the fact that we needed some people with specific skills (UX and web design, coding ability) in Berlin made the process more complicated. In the end, we asked potential applicants to include an account of  previous involvement, a list of their hard skills, the amount of time they could commit to being  in Berlin and a reference from another P2PU community member in their application. These were   evaluated by a group of 2 staffers and 2 volunteers, who made recommendation based on an   applicant’s track record in the community, the quality of their proposed project,   their skills and the length of their stay. In addition, we invited applications from some   developers via Google’s summer of code internship programme, in order to make sure we got   enough people with hard skills into the office. This method was better than others we have used   in the past, but is still not 100% satisfactory because it was difficult to evaluate some    applications from newbies.LogisticsEAT - The team that eats together, meets togetherP2PU people take good food very seriously, and cooking and eating together was one of the activities we wanted to encourage during the pop-up. One of the apartments was doubled as a communal cooking space, and one of the volunteers was designated chef. We provided the ingredients for several team meals, some of which were open to guests, and others which were kept smaller. WORK - Just, like, do itFinding the ideal space was a priority for the organisers. We knew we needed a large area, but renting an office felt too formal, and we wanted to connect with other communities in the city. Locating P2PU within an existing co-working space and community made the most sense. Berlin is well known for having several co-working spaces, with desks for rent. We decided to use the  Agora Collective, a group of co-working enthusiasts in the south-west of Berlin. Several factors  attracted us: the price was good, AGORA have a large space, including a silent working area,   and were able to provide us with a room for noisier working sessions. They have a cafe on the   ground floor which provided daily lunches and coffee, and we were able to use the space on   weekends. The deliberately un-commercial and less tech-heavy culture that AGORA have created   was not a factor in choosing the space, but was, in hindsight, a benefit.  SLEEP - No rest until NeuköllnAll participants were given a maximum budget for renting apartments in Berlin, and encouraged to self-organise, with advice from staffers on the best areas, travel logistics, and how to get around. This worked well, not only because it was cheaper and saved the organisers a great deal of effort, but because it contributed to the group dynamic,  particularly for staffers and volunteers who had not met before.  PLAY - More than video gamesThe social aspect of P2PU meetings has always been important, and one of the objectives of the residency was to provide staffers and volunteers to spend time together outside of work. This was helped by the fact that several participants had friends or partners visit them during their  time in Berlin, which helped us to remember to stop working and have some fun. A shared google  calendar was started for people to add events, and these included organised outings to galleries  and museums, group meals at restaurants (subsidised by P2PU) a visit to a traditional beer   garden and an evening barbecue at Templehof airport. Berlin has no shortage of interesting   diversions, and a highlight was the visit several participants made to Teufelsberg,   an abandoned NSA listening post on a man-made hill in the forests west of the city.  While we knew that there were some special projects that we wanted to work on during the Berlin residencey, one of the objectives was to allow P2PU staffers and volunteers to get on with the  day-to-day work of P2PU, which is usually done remotely.To this end, we structured the days fairly loosely, starting with a morning stand-up at 10am, at which all participants would present what they had done the day before and what they were intending to do that day (in 2 minutes or less!). We also encouraged informal work discussions over coffee and in the garden at AGORA.While we encouraged an informal atmosphere, we also expected participants to work an 8-hour day, and be available for some weekend work during events we held with partners (Creative Commons and Mozilla). This proved to be harder to manage than we expected - people who are accustomed to working remotely tend to have their own rhythms, and several participants felt that the working days were too structured and too long. Organisers, on the other hand, were frustrated by participants who regularly arrived late.Some afternoon and evening activities (visits to galleries and other sites and team meals) were planned and it was made clear that attendance, while not mandatory, was expected. We also encouraged participants who were in Berlin for the duration of the month to take one full day off.Being a distributed community, with members all over the world, access and participation are always issues that we are aware of at P2PU. In an effort to connect the the Berlin office with the wider community we tried as much as possible to broadcast what we were working on (and solicit other opinions) via the web.Daily standups were blogged the same day, new work was posted to the mailing list and blog, and several public conference calls were held to encourage participation from those in the community who were unable to join the event.ReflectionsIt is always difficult to sum up experiences like the Berlin residency, and there is always a risk that some perspectives are more weighted than others.When an event is funded externally, as this was, there is also an obligation on the part of organisers to show funders that their money has been well-spent, but some outcomes that are difficult to quantify. We have used several mechanics to do this, but it is also important to remember that some benefits, like community building and workflows which lead to greater efficiency are harder to measure. In this respect, it has been useful to take a longer-term view, look at the organisation 6 months after the event and see how our working methods have changed  and where improvements have been made.If we evaluate the experiment from a project point of view, there were many positive outcomes. The UX and mentorship projects were realised, the mechanical MOOC was prototyped and those not able to join the event were able to follow and participate online. While there were frustrations, these were not always insurmountable, and in some cases were a result of miscommunication. We  asked participants for feedback from the event, and asked them to rate the experience in terms  of green, orange and red (green = things they liked, orange = things they had concerns or  questions about and red = things they did not like). Using this matrix may be the best way of  evaluating the success of the month-long experiment. One thing that is evident from the range of  responses is that there is a spectrum of different opinions on every topic. Some found the   daily routine too intense, others wanted more structure. However, the overwhelming sense from   participants is that the experiment was a success, and they would be happy to take part again.One issue which became clear early on was that while organisers chose to deliberately avoided big-picture strategy-type discussions, because experience has shown that they can be time consuming and not all that productive, participants felt that this was a major omission.In order to have as sense of ownership over a project, particularly one that is as community-driven as P2PU, people want to have those conversations, and this is something that needs to be accommodated.For the organisers, the overall feeling coming out of the experiment was that it was a success, but not without sticking points. Managing expectations was difficult, and organisers felt that they should have articulated their expectations, at least about working hours and logistics earlier in the process and more clearly.There were also the inevitable difficulties of any funded event, where organisers expected certain commitment from funded participants, and these did not always materialise. As loose and self-organised as much of the residency was, organisers also felt exhausted by the end of the month, particularly since they had spent several months in the lead-up to the event working on logistics and planning.OpinionsCheck the highlight responses from the survey, marked in the red/orange/green matrix:					“The city of Berlin itself.”			...“Working at a collaborative space was super interesting.”			...Interactions and conversations with the people stood out! Both during 'office hours' and after			hours.”			...“Working on a project for 2 weeks and getting lots of stuff done.”							“Strategy-type meetings should have been at beginning instead of end, and with only those volunteers			interested/appropriate.”			...			“Too intense. We should take Fridays off.”			...			“More opportunities to connect with locals. I ended up meeting with some people in the Berlin tech scene			on my own, but I think a lot of people would love to have an event to meet local groups.”							“More discussions and work planning before the event would give us a better picture.”			...			“Maybe instead of listing the topics of the stand-ups, we could have a visual tool showing progress of			things.”			...			“A stricter separation between meeting time and work time; perhaps even have it planned out a bit more			ahead of time so that as participants we can plan better for what we want to accomplish and how much			time we'll have to accomplish it.”		NumbersP2PU Berlin Pop-up Office in numbers:									6 Dinners			Pic by mozzadrella												8 Countries			Pic by mozzadrella												145k Km Traveled			Pic by rr0cketqueen, CC BY SA												35 Blog Posts			Pic by bagaball, CC BY													12 Showcases			Pic by mozzadrella												1 Mechanical Mooc			Pic by rr0cketqueen, CC BY SA				See more milestones and funny facts in our DATUM profile.",

	"text": "  Introduction  School of Ed  What We’ve Learned  Challenges and Puzzles  An InvitationIntroductionMany of the professional development experiences available to K-12 educators are lackluster; at their worst, they can be uninspiring, inauthentic, and ineffective. At it’s best though, professional learning can be stimulating, inquiry-driven, and powerful. It can ignite the lives of both teachers and learners. The question then is, how can teachers be helped to spend more time in these rich experiences? What is it that sets these experiences apart?The impetus behind deeper professional learning is to apply the ideas of inquiry, self-direction, critical thinking, and collaboration to the professional learning available to educators in  order to have experiences that enrich their learning and that of their students.After all, if teachers don’t participate in this kind of learning, how can they be expected to understand and apply it in classrooms?A couple years ago, I began to take a closer look at my own experiences in professional development, both as a participant and as a facilitator, and found them to be lacking.Too often I found myself standing on a literal stage suggesting that such methods were less than optimal in participants’ own learning environments. Too often the workshop agendas were being set by the district administration with little or no input from participants. Too often there was  not enough time for meaningful group discussion, collaboration, and hands-on work,  and too little follow-up after the main event.School of EdThis led me to explore other learning models, in particular peer learning in open spaces. Through Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU), I found a model of learning that was participant-driven, community-based, and open (in all senses of the word). While my first experiences with this model were not in the education space, I soon began to see the obvious application to professional learning for teachers.And so began the P2PU School of Education. We started with a small amount of funding from the Hewlett Foundation and some basic ideas of what we wanted to do – provide authentic, peer learning experiences for K-12 teachers around high interest topics.In the fall of 2011, we launched our first seven courses. The topics included: Student Engagement, Teaching in Online and Blended Classrooms, OER in the K-12 Classroom, Differentiating Instruction, Using Web 2.0 and Social Media to Encourage Deeper Learning, Writing and the Common Core, and Multimedia and Graphics to Facilitate Deeper Learning. Each of these courses was developed and facilitated by an educator with expertise in the area.Living Up To (and Defying) ExpectationsThese courses were well received. Some of our initial premises were proven out. The learning was extremely social, and high quality facilitation was critical. Among our richest experiences were the asynchronous online discussion threads and the synchronous gatherings via web-based tools like G+.Together, we explored and negotiated the meaning of the topics we were studying and worked together to apply it to our own learning contexts.Other suppositions we had were not supported. Surprisingly, the high quality content we had invested in developing was not the most important part of these groups. In fact, participants valued the conversations they had with peers more than anything else.And some of these discussions prompted participants to suggest their own course-related collaborative activities that were far more useful than the ones we as developers had originally planned.Facilitation is CriticalSimilarly, we found that the most important instructor/facilitator skills were not necessarily content expertise, but rather community building and group facilitation ability. Contrary to what we originally supposed, a high level of content expertise on the part of facilitators may even  dampen the peer learning experience, as participants are more prone to want to be “taught” by  the experts, rather than fully engaging in the peer experience.One challenge we ran into, not uncommon for online learning, was sustaining participation levels. Participation seemed at times to be sporadic or declining; however, when we probed deeper,  we found that there were a significant number of “lurkers” who were gaining value from the  course, despite their apparent lack of active, visible participation.As we’ve offered more courses and groups over time, we have come to understand that peer learning is a new experience for many people. Self-direction in learning is often not a natural or  comfortable task for those who are not practiced in it. In fact, we launched a study group to  look specifically at this, which was called Empowering Your Personal Learning. This kind of  participant-inspired, inquiry-driven group has prompted some of the most successful learning  groups.What We’ve LearnedAlmost two years and 30 or so courses later, there are many things that we have learned in this grand experiment.First, in our experience, the formation of community has been critical. The social nature of peer learning relies on trust and relationships. This is not something that can be fostered over a  few weeks. While this kind of community-building takes time, we are beginning to see some  evidence of it at P2PU. In large part this has been due to the ongoing,  generous participation of many individuals, as well as organizations such as the National  Writing Project. We have benefitted greatly from the participation of their already-existing  community of passionate and deep thinking educators who share our values and goals.We have also learned that peer learning experiences work best when they are designed by the group, not instituted from the top down. This can be challenging to achieve, but the groups that have been co-planned and co-facilitated collaboratively have been most compelling.We’ve found that diverse groups of learners add to the conversation. At P2PU, we have significant international participation, as well as that from various disciplines and professions. Even for groups that deal with what appear to be U.S.-centric topics, like the Common Core, having this diversity of participants has made the conversations richer.In terms of logistics, shorter courses (three to four weeks) seem better able to maintain momentum, while still giving enough time for in-depth exploration.These shorter courses can then spin off into more in-depth, follow-up explorations. A defined start and end time has also seemed to encourage participation, as opposed to an open, rolling enrollment.Learning for Students and TeachersOne of the most pleasant surprises at the School of Ed has been the advent of peer learning groups with students and teachers involved together. Harry Brake from the American School Foundation in Mexico City started a project on P2PU in which students write grants to fund community service projects that they design. This was inspired by a face-to-face project that Mr. Brake had started in Delaware. Now, with this project being online,  teachers and students from other parts of the world, as well as a variety of non-profit  organizations, have connected and participated.Another creative and ground-breaking educator, Paul Allison, from the Bronx Academy Senior High, has extended his curriculum through the P2PU community as well. Mr. Allison is a co-founder of Youth Voices. Youth Voices is a school-based social network that encourages students to write about their passions, connect with other students, comment on each other’s work, and create multimedia about topics that are important to them. This is deeper learning in action.The Youth Voices project has recently been expanded to be a full, Common Core-aligned curriculum in English Language Arts, Social Studies, Arts and Media, and Science. Through this, students are completing projects on subjects of their own choosing at their own pace and direction. Mr. Allison has designed and incorporated badges into this through the P2PU community. For their work, students are awarded badges that count for credit toward graduation. While some  call this a gamification of education, one of Mr. Allison’s students, Anthony,  aptly pointed out that “this is no game.” These students are doing in-depth projects that not  only develop core academic skills, but hone important deeper learning skills of collaboration,  communication, critical thinking, self-direction, and persistence.While students are clearly benefitting from this, teachers around world are also benefitting. We’re seeing how an innovative approach like this can work. We’re thinking through complex issues like how deeper learning can be aligned to the Common Core, how student self-direction can be  prompted and tracked, and how assessment and credit can be tied these projects.Through this important work, we’ve seen that online collaborations with teachers and students can be powerful. And as in my face-to-face experiences, I’ve seen that students often drive the  innovation in formal educational environments.This is a promising area for further development at P2PU.Challenges and PuzzlesAs much as we’ve learned over the course of this experiment, we still have even more to figure out.One issue that we’ve wrestled with is the open nature of our learning community. Openness can mean many things, and at P2PU it includes having open-licensed (Creative Commons) content that can be freely shared, remixed, and redistributed; having enrollment that is free and open to anyone in the world; and having group activities be freely viewable on the Internet and not behind firewalls. We believe that this kind of openness and transparency encourages a kind of participation that is uniquely beneficial.However, we also recognize that for those who are new to peer and online learning, this openness can be unnerving. In fact, other communities have reported that openness like this can actually discourage participation by some. This is a conundrum we have not resolved.Maintaining MomentumAnother question that plagues many online communities including ours is how to sustain momentum. Teachers are under unprecedented time pressures and finding the time to participate in extra professional learning opportunities like these is difficult. At the present, participation at the P2PU School of Ed, for both participants and facilitators, is an opt-in, volunteer activity.This connects to the challenge of how to give formal recognition for participation in this professional learning. Currently, P2PU offers neither formal university continuing education credits, nor stipends, for participation. We have considered this at great length and pondered the pros and cons. To offer stipends in some ways seems to run counter to the intrinsic motivation inherent in this kind of learning.Many of us have seen the sometimes detrimental effects of professional development that is offered on a pay-for-attendance basis. On the other hand, teachers certainly should be adequately compensated for the important work they do, and most district pay schedules do not provide this.Securing university credit for participation in our courses also has its challenges. Initial pursuits toward this highlighted some of the differences between informal and formal learning, such as participation measures (seat time vs. a competency measure), the role of a syllabus (predetermined and unchanging vs. “hack the syllabus” and make it up as you go), assessment measures (traditional vs. authentic), and even facilitator qualifications (traditionally certified vs. peer facilitators). For the present time, we have decided that the compromises we might have to make to be certified to grant formal credit may not be worth the trade-offs. And still, we recognize that teachers need this formal credit  to be recertified and to advance on the salary scale.We have also pondered the potential intersections between informal learning, such as that happening at P2PU, and formal learning, including the many district-provided professional development in-services. We would love to see some districts begin to experiment with deeper professional learning within their institutions. The P2PU platform is free to use, and all the content already housed there is open licensed. We are willing and eager to collaborate with K-12 organizations who might want to experiment with applying this model to their own learning needs.An Invitation			We see the P2PU School of Ed as an on-going experiment for looking at deeper learning in a 		professional context. We invite anyone who is interested in this area to join us.				There are many ways to participate including joining an existing group, 		suggesting a topic for a new group, co-designing a group with us, or co-facilitating a group.				We believe that deeper professional learning has the potential to change not only how we learn as		 adults, but also to affect how we facilitate learning with students.

	"title": "MOOC Maker",
	"text": "  Introduction  Community Is Key  Where, What &amp; Why  Reflections  PostscriptIntroductionIn late 2011 there was a rumbling in the air around the open education space… Massive, open, online courses were springing up all over the web. Two distinct types begin to emerge out of the MOOC model - Connectivist MOOCS (or cMOOCS) and Instructivist (or xMOOCS). Both were large-scale online learning experiments, with very different theories of learning behind them. In the open educational field, practitioners, activists and communities of interest were beginning to think about the component parts of cMOOCS and how they might work together, rather than adding to the emerging model of a proliferation of MOOC platforms, many of which seemed to be recreating the same thing repeatedly.At P2PU, we’d been talking to our collaborators at MIT OpenCourseWare and had been struggling with the problem of how to move learners in a cohort through the exciting new world of the MOOC. “I’d read a blog about using RSS feeds, as a kind of time-release capsule for OER material, which would send learners a reminder, and thought it was a really interesting idea, but I knew that RSS was a bit too esoteric for many students, and it didn’t solve the cohort problem,” says Steve Carson, Head of External Relations at MIT OpenCourseWare.The solution, we soon realised, would look a little bit like a mailing list sign-up, without a platform per se, which would allow organisers to loop in the various component parts and run what is essentially a headless MOOC; no instructor was placed at the centre, and after a certain number of signups was reached, the MOOC itself would trigger messages to everyone in the group.Community Is KeySerendipitously, we were able to tap into the community of Python learners on Open Study, one of our project partners. This well-established network of co-learners (about 17 thousand of them) meant that we were able to set up the community in a way that allowed us to ask questions to the wider group – so if any users had questions, they could refer them to a community that was much larger than the course itself. And all of those people, many of whom had lots of experience, were willing to answer questions.Steve experimented with this community during the testing phase, “I tried it myself. The first task was to build a rock, paper, scissors game, and I posted the code to OpenStudy and asked people there to take a look at it, before course had started. Someone did, and they answered my questions, gave me feedback, and showed me how I could have done the same thing better and faster with about 15 fewer lines of code.” By posting the answers, and getting people to discuss the posts, we realised that the optimum situation is to be able to plug into an online community which is larger than the course itself. The community become the subject experts.Where, What &amp; WhyWhile a method of communication is a good start, no course can run without something to learn from, and place in which to do the learning.The lightweight model we were developing didn’t allow for recruiting or focussing on subject-experts, so we decided to structure the course by dividing our content into a series of sequenced modules and arranging it in order. This made for distinct blocks of content, easy enough for learners to work through in a group, in any order, without needing step-by-step guidance. We tested this by creating a test cohort, which worked through the materials pre-launch. Early results were not encouraging - everyone dropped out by week 6!This turned out to be a blessing in disguise - high dropout rates in online courses are an accepted part of the landscape - but many people who drop out of courses often plan to come back to the materials when they have more time. However, not many of the set-ups being tested allowed for looping back in. Our test cohort’s experience showed us that it would be important to create a space where materials and the messages from the MOOC could be stored and accessed by users. We did this using a Wordpress blog to store the weekly emails. This site became one of the most-used resources for the course, and has enabled people to drop back in as and when they want to.Why Python?A Python course made the most sense as a pilot because we found ourselves at a convergence point of materials,  ommunity and platform. P2PU’s active community of webmaker learners, coupled with the community available, and the volume of OER materials made a lot of sense. We were looking to test a concept, rather than make a particular impact with the subject, but in theory any subject which suits automated assessment would have worked. Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner and Chris Meyers’ How Think Like a Computer Scientist: Think Python is an open textbook which has been used for several years for anyone wanting to learn Python programming. This, in combination with the materials from MIT’s Gentle Introduction to Python course, covered the content component of the MOOC.Give It A VoiceComputer Science textbooks aren’t always the most exciting learning materials in the world. But research shows that people learn better when they’re having a good experience. After some discussions, we decided that it would be good to create a character who would deliver the messages - a kind of steampunk International MOOC of Mystery. The irony was intentional - we wanted people to understand that a machine was talking to them, as if other MOOCs weren’t machines! It also allowed those who were writing the text to have a bit of fun, with an anchor for for presenting content that, if you’re not careful, can come across like different shades of eggshell paint.Think about ScaleThe objective, when we built the Python MOOC, was not to recreate the huge scale of other MOOCs. At least, not at first. But as we worked on it, and realised that the model was both lightweight and resilient enough to handle larger numbers, we began to set our sights higher. A few hundred people was no longer enough - we decided to spread the word, and thanks to our partners, we found ourselves with over 5000 people signing up after the launch. Four more iterations of the MOOC have been run since then, and each time, we have been able to adjust the grouping,  tweak messaging and rethink content management, in order to experiment with different ways of  learning, and optimise the experience for all the participants, no matter what the size of the  group is.ReflectionsWhy It WorkedThe overall sense with the Python MOOC was that the interest in it proved the concept. It is possible to build a MOOC for very little money: At a total cost of roughly U$4000 dollars and some developer time, we were able to build a MOOC for nowhere near the quarter of a million dollars that some institutions are investing in MOOCs. A Gentle Intro To Python has shown that in terms of providing people with a robust learning experience at scale,  it can be done for next to nothing. Secondly, it is possible to build a MOOC without having to  invest time or money into complex platform development. Using different tools which can be  bolted on for the community, assessment content components gave us the opportunity to try  different forums, abandon those that weren’t working and try new ones. One of the issues in MOOC  research at the moment is the over investment in content development, however,   our experiment has shown that by putting a relatively small amount of energy and effort into   the assessment and community components, we were able to run an effective MOOC. And it was so   damn much fun. Often in higher education you have to be a little bit buttoned up,   but with this, we were able to do the best we could, set expectations, and experiment,   and invite others to do this with us.PostscriptSince launching A Gentle Intro to Python, we have run 4 more iterations of the course. We have also improved and tweaked the platformless model and used it to run learning experiences on data wrangling with our partners at The Open Knowledge Foundation, and Learning Creative learning with the Lifelong Kindergarten research group at the MIT Media Lab. Researchers from the University  of Maryland have begun to crunch some of the data generated by the MOOC in order to lift the lid  on the learning that’s going on. We’ve also working on new ways to improve the MOOC experience   by adding more interactive tools - the class photo   feature lets users see their peers,   and we’re working on adding’ like hangouts and video to the model.

	"text": "The Problem SetAs a learning community, P2PU is part of a larger ecosystem of online education with different trends, economic models and approaches to recognition and measurement. From where we sit, assessment is the biggest hurdle to innovation in how people learn. It is designed around the way learning was structured in the past. Every learner was expected to master the same body of knowledge, going at the same speed, using the same learning resources and approaches.The web has changed the way we learn. The way we recognize learning hasn’t.Online, we are distributed, and so are our curiosities and interests. There is no “one size fits all” model of the internet. The web calls us to participate in a way that makes us uniquely  equal. Sparks of interaction, conversations, moments of feedback on the web are truly  peer-to-peer, and assessment on the web needs to reflect this shift.The LandscapeIf you look around the web, this is already happening: communities are coming up with their own mechanisms for feedback and recognition.Both Quora and Stack Overflow rally responses around a problem or a question. Someone may ask “How does Google Maps pinpoint my location using HTML5?” and members from the community provide answers. The community votes the replies of users “Up” or “Down” based on how helpful or accurate the reply is until a problem is “Answered.” Users receive “credit” for their investment in a correct answer—a status they can (and do) outwardly  share.Other communities like GitHub and Scratch recognize projects by how often they are forked or remixed by other members. In these technical communities, creating projects that other people can build on is a measure of expertise and status.A New Way to Look at LearningParticipating is learning. By observing and chiming in with your ideas in an online community, over time you’re learning several things: the domain of the community (i.e. code, techno, lolzcatz), and how to communicate within it (i.e. communication tools, but also etiquette, are emotiji appropriate?). An online presence is a blend of “soft” and “hard” skills, and they are interconnected.Communities decide what’s acceptable. Voting an answer up-or-down, liking a post, or remixing a project–these are different levels of granularity, but anyone in the community can give feedback on any project. The community decides what’s good and what’s not,  and folks who make stellar contributions are celebrated.Feedback is key. It’s actually a core skill in a community of practice. Whether it’s leaving a comment on a post, suggestions on a project, or answering an open question, giving feedback is a way to apply the norms and values of a community. Giving feedback is also a kind of learning–in and of itself.Our Conception of the Solution SetWe know that the web affects learning. We don’t know how this is all going to play out, but we are going to spend the next few weeks rethinking assessment on the web. This is an open conversation-as an organization, we have an opinion about social learning and recognition-but we still have more questions than answers.

	"text": "As we discussed earlier, we’ll be thinking about assessment on the web for the next few weeks. This week, we’ll look at our priorities for assessment, and walk through some examples of how these ideas work in action.Design PrinciplesAs learning on the web has evolved and “grown up”, a few innovative trends have emerged. Certain principles tap all the connectedness that the web has to offer. Of the learning communities we consider successful and that we admire, several share the following principles:      Recognize different paths to the answer. Traditional assessment structures often resemble binary code: they are either on (right) or off (wrong). There’s a mismatch between this kind of black-and-white approach and working on complex projects: solutions are often iterative, and understanding grows over time. Say you’re an urbanplanner tasked with building a new park. There are countless ways to approach the problem–you could optimize for greenery, for social interaction, for ecological impact–and all of the  answers would be relevant. Real world problems often have several solutions. The way we learn  and recognize learning should not be “one size fits all.”        Model concepts of quality and community norms.Learning communities determine what is “in” or acceptable, and what isn’t. Community moderators or experienced members often shine a light on what they consider to be of quality, for instance with “Featured Projects” or “Projects We Love” gallery. Imparting exemplary work with some sense of status models behavior for the wider community.        Foster deep conversations and social presence amongst community members.As mentioned in our previous post, participating in a learning community is a way to master both a domain and the norms and values of a community. For example, say you post your latest crochetmittens to the knitting community site Raverly. The feedback from the community will: a.) make your future crochet projects more stitch-perfect and,  b.) model for you how to participate in the larger Raverly community. If you’re stuck on a  certain pattern, consulting experts on Ravelry can buoy you up, help you overcome obstacles  and take risks.        Build in reflection and self-assessment.In educational circles we often hear about building a “reflective practice”–asking learners to look back on their own work, diagnose their understanding, and imagine how they might use these skills in the future. In eduspeak we call this “metacognition”: thinking about your thinking. Which is positively correlated with lifelong learning and self-directed exploration. Which I think we can all agree is a good thing.        Support a learner’s continued growth and evolution.E-portfolios and other similar mechanisms make space to showcase how we evolve, and tap the wealth of resources available on the web. As learners progress they gain visibility within a community, and they are expected to take on increasing responsibilities, e.g. to help others, provide feedback, or maintain the norms of the community.  Folks Who Do It WellAs part of the open &amp; online education community, we’ve come across scores of platforms and learning networks. A few of the ones we admire put in place several of the assessment principles we outlined above.Scratch, the playful programming environment out of the Lifelong Kindgergarden Group at the MIT Media Lab, hosts a vibrant online learning community for its “Scratchers.” To onboard new community members, the front page models what the community determines to be of quality–the ”Featured Projects”  area shines a light on exemplary projects. To draw a path for new learners through the  community, users pass through the phases of “New Scratcher” “Scratcher” and “Community  Moderator.” There’s even a whole group in the forums to support new Scratch members.These labels are useful: the community understands that New Scratchers need more support and feedback to get off the ground. Then as learners acclimate to the culture, they are recognized as experts and become “Scratchers.” Each label does its part to support a sense of belonging amongst community members. Additionally, Scratch offers multiple ways to develop strong social ties with other Scratchers by enabling sub-communities to form around any interest. This strengthens the feeling that Scratch can be a home for the learner, and a place where she can find others with similar passions. Scratcher online profiles create a portfolio-type effect that allow you to observe the set of a learner’s projects, but also projects of other Scratchers they liked, and active curation of projects in the community. Scratchers also frequently reflect on their own work, and the strategies they followed to implement certain features, in the project descriptions they leave for others.Instructables is another popular learning community where members showcase their DIY projects. The learner profiles showcase the diversity of projects learners have worked on, forming a kind of portfolio that evolves over time. Like other communities on the web, instructables has forums, a question-and-answer mechanism, and groups that have formed around certain interests. Unlike other learning communities, the learner profiles reflect their individual participation in each area, recognizing their expertise and engagement in the community.Another unique aspect about instructables is that the platform asks you to step out your creation so that others can replicate it. If you post a claymation Halloween mask, the platform asks you to walk through carving the mold, adding a mustache and glueing the googly-eyes.Not only does this platform recognize different paths to the answer–you could probably find 20 different posts on making Halloween masks–the very act of walking through what you’ve made and explaining it to someone else is a type of self-assessment. Open QuestionsWhile our assessment experiences touch on each of these principles, there are several nuts we have yet to crack. One outstanding question is how to approach expertise in an online community. We’re a bit uncomfortable with the term “Expert,” since it implies hierarchy, but sometimes it is crucial to get feedback from someone who has a lot of expertise. How do we treat those with more experience in an egalitarian way? And how to  do make sure that we scale access to expertise - having the world’s foremost expert answer  emails from every new member of a community simply doesn’t scale.Assessment needs to be radically rethought, but it’s difficult to experiment when the stakes are high. Informal learning groups have the freedom to experiment–we can tinker,  innovate and try out new ideas. However, there’s a disconnect between what is happening in  informal learning spaces and how that is recognized in the traditional system of certification  and accreditation. “Badges for Lifelong Learning” has attempted to bridge the gap between  informal learning and legitimate recognition, but perhaps they are only one step in this  direction. How can we make alternative assessment “count”?			Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by																							 Disqus.	comments powered by Disqus",

	"title": "Assessment on the Web",
	"text": "A Different Way to Look at LearningWhat we’d like to suggest is an approach that great instructors already know to be true: when a student gives feedback or support to another student, that process deepens their own understanding. In the case of learning to program, students with expertise actually learn more when they work with students who have less expertise. In writing courses, the researchsuggests that the act of critiquing another’s work measurably improves the quality of your own. We can associate peer feedback with dozens of other skills, including communication, conflict resolution, negotiation, and empathy.It’s a bit edu-speak, but bear with us: what we mean to suggest is that you can learn through assessing someone else. That statement has massive implications, good ones, for learning communities on the web. Not only will communities come up with their own notions of quality (the software development community GitHub has “core contributors” as an example) but  communities can also scale to meet the needs of many learners in a personal way.Let that resonate for a second. Scale to meet the needs of learners–in a personal way.If we recognize that problems might have several answers, and feedback on your project extends your own learning, then every path is unique and personal. This is the promise of assessment on the web.At P2PU, we’ve experimented quite a bit with peer feedback and collaborative work. We’ve made several prototypes for alternative assessment, and experimented with different kinds of cohorts for learning.Emerging Themes and Opportunities We’re Excited AboutAs part of the open &amp; online education community, we’ve come across scores of platforms and learning networks. A few of the ones we admire put in place several of the assessment principles we outlined previously.      (Better) learning analytics.And by that, we don’t mean pageviews or time-on-site–those things are easy to measure, but not necessarily what should be measured. We’re interested in how communities establish their notions of quality, and how individuals learn how to become part of a community. SoundCloud features the ability to embed comments within the waveform of a sound (a neat way to indicate quality).Some of the things we would like to see analytics for are patterns of behavior that show learning mindsets,  a set of non-cognitive skills and dispositions that turn out to be very important for academic  success. For example, when you feel part of a learning community, you’re more likely to overcomesetbacks and develop a more positive mindset towards academic work. We’ll be looking at analytics to see which variables or interactions make folks feel like they are “part of” something, or belong.        Collaborative video conferencing.Folks in the e-learning space often refer to the importance of developing “social presence” in online courses–or a sense of trust that you’re working with real people. Video conferencing  tools like Google Hangout (or our unconference version Unhangout) enable us to work together inreal time. Tools like Chef Hangout and Google Helpoutare already experimenting in this way, and we have tinkered with real-time “data learning sprints” with the Open Knowledge Foundation. Yet, there is no good way to track what happens in these live sessions and record individual contributions or achievements. In the classroom, it’s easy to keep track of the students who ask good questions, or give helpful answers. To do this at scale, we need to better understand which parts of synchronous conversations we should pay attention to.        Curating your own achievements.Portfolios are a great way to show what you’ve done (and what you care about), but they are traditionally bound to the institution, not the individual. Portfolios that live on the web are more flexible and we can tie the opinions of our peers into them. Badges for  Lifelong Learning is one way to display  the skills you’ve learned in a handy “backpack.” LinkedIn is also  attempting to curate recognition with their “endorsements” feature. We’re excited to see how  folks put together their array of skills, and how those portfolios might challenge traditional  accreditation.  Let’s recapAccreditation is the main roadblock to innovation in assessment and the wider educational landscape. Credentials are often the gatekeepers to opportunity, recognition, success. Unfortunately, accreditation systems are extremely slow to change, often deeply hierarchical, and transcripts don’t tell us much about interpersonal skills or mastery. But the web can.On the web, communities come up with their own way to recognize accomplishment. Sometimes they are in line with traditional accreditation and sometimes they are not. These mechanisms are transparent and evolve over time in step with the way communities work and learn. Not surprisingly software developers were the first professional community to do this. They have developed standards of accomplishment and recognition that are built on the web. Other communities are following.We’ve proposed a number of “opportunities” for how assessment can evolve on the web. The tension between new ways to recognize learning, and the old mechanisms of accrediting learning will increase. And however accreditation shakes out, the web will be an important aspect of how we showcase to others what we have done, the things we have learned, and who we are.

	"text": "  About #PWYM  Design Principles and Tools  Learning Ensembles  Findings  DiscussionAbout #PWYMIf someone says “online course” you might think about a very passive experience, like watching lectures, talking multiple choice quizzes, or reading out of an e-book. At P2PU we focus on passion, play and projects, and we were seeing less “play” in the exercises and tutorials in the online education landscape. We wanted to change the conversation, to encourage creative expression and nurture originality. We believed we could offer a learning experience that would include mastering new skills, certainly, but do so as a byproduct of creative projects.Play With Your Music is about learning music while playing with music. It’s a hands-on introduction to the creative processes of audio engineers and producers. The first six-week course provided an introduction to critical listening, strategies for learning from recordings, musical uses of audio effects, mixing and remixing. In November 2013, over 5,000 participants signed up to participate. They worked together in small “Learning Ensembles” of 30-40 people to make their own mixes and remixes, and shared their sounds along the way via SoundCloud.com.From the outset, the #PWYM team–Dr. Alex Ruthmann (NYU), Ethan Hein (NYU), Vanessa Gennarelli (P2PU) and Dirk Uys (P2PU)– approached the course as a design-based research project. We were interested in ways to build a sense of “belonging” to a community in an online space. Our hypothesis was that small groups with shared musical interests or tastes would sustain engagement, support peer learning, and prompt deeper feedback. We wanted folks to feel like they  had a “crew” they could depend on.We wanted to develop not just a great learning experience, but a design-driven research project to grow knowledge around peer-driven learning online. In this paper we reflect on the aims, the experience, and the lessons learned from PWYM.Fast Facts      A big crew: 5,232 folks signed up, we formed 132 cohorts of 30-40 learners each          1,743 active members in the PWYM G+ community, 24 cohorts formed their own groups on G+          Say cheese! 1,533 members uploaded photos to their class photo          Making music, together. The #PWYM SoundCloud group had nearly 30,000 listens, 1,500 favorites, and 550 downloads and 500 comments  Design Principles and ToolsWhen we look back at it now, the fact that only four weeks elapsed between our kickoff meeting and opening for signups seems insane. In four short weeks we built a website, developed promotional materials, wrote a grouping script, designed the learning content and activities, shot and edited videos, recruited and scheduled guest speakers, drafted the assessment program, tested the tools, and reached out to music communities around the web.It helps if you have a common mission. #PWYM shared some common design principles that we kept in mind as we built each aspect of the course:      #PWYM would be about lifelong learning for the widest possible audience.This content would be accessible, targeted at beginners, and playful. This meant designing experiences around free, browser-based creative tools that fostered sharing, collaboration and peer feedback. We also partnered with singer/songwriter Clara Berry and her engineer/producer Bradford Swanson to provide musical multitracks as interactive course content that PWYM participants could work with.        Design for low floors and high ceilings.We would make sure there were easy ways to get started and lots of possibilities to take projects further. We curated some of the best pre-existing online instructional videos,  and created introductory videos modeling use of the the course’s creative tools to lower the  floor of entry. To engage the more experienced learners, we designed open-ended analysis  templates and encouraged all participants to share their expertise through peer-feedback and  contributions to the course resources.        Empower learners with choices.If they want to use Google+ or another musical engineering program–great! Each week of the course, participants were encouraged to apply the tools to their own favorite music (analysis) or creative mixes and remixes of course material. Participants were encouraged to create their own  original piece to be shared the last week of the course on SoundCloud.com and the Google+ group.Finally, all course content emails were posted to the PWYM blog so stragglers or outsiders could follow along at their own pace.        Model a reflective practice.Both the weekly instructional videos and live interview questions were focused on sharing one’s creative thinking and practice processes, with a special focus on the musical, expressive, and creative intentions behind their work. A reflective sharing component was built into each week’s assignments with the directive to share one’s creative works and reflections with the broader Google+ community.        Design for social presence.Give learners the feeling that they are interacting with real people, not just a pseudonym. Create opportunities for folks to cohere and share personal stuff from their lives. The live interviews also enabled a “real” connection and opportunities through group chat to ask questions.  With these design principles in mind, we utilized the following structures and tools:      Mechanical MOOC: A grouping script to form small cohorts of learners to communicate via email.        Google+: umbrella for the whole #PWYM community, used to post resources, questions, projects and feedback.        Soundation.com: a digital audio workstation to help folks learn the basics of mixing and remixing.        SoundCloud.com: an online repository for #PWYM folks to post their masterpieces.        Unhangout: a forum for videoconference-style Q&amp;A with our weekly guest speakers.        Badges: a means for learners to assess their skills and receive feedback.        Weekly newsletters: a way to showcase exemplary projects and take a wide-angle lens on the developments in the community.        GIFs. Lots of GIFs.  Learning EnsemblesThinkers in the learning landscape are interested in developing a sense of “belonging to a learning community” as a means to motivate learners. This is certainly a big area of interest for P2PU, and is reflected in many of our design principles for PWYM. If you feel as though you fit  in a group and deserve to be there, you’ll feel positively about learning,  not shy away from challenges, and reach out to others to help buoy you up when you need help. A  sense of belonging can help overcome certain roadblocks for learners. Folks who feel like they  don’t belong can display poor learning behaviors. They might not ask questions if they feel out  of place, not wanting to draw attention to their outsider status. In the open online learning  environment these challenges are particularly relevant, given we are often dealing with learners  with no prior ties to one another, varying degrees of preparedness,   and the ability to drop off at any time with little accountability for their absence.For #PWYM, we decided to create cohorts of 30-40 folks, grouped based on their musical taste, to create learning communities to which learners could feel they belonged. When learners came to www.playwithyourmusic.org to sign up, they were asked what their top 5 musical artists were. From that data, we used the Echonest API to form “learning ensembles” with overlapping and similar  taste. A nice side-effect of using a tool like Echonest is the ability to collect data and  visualize the communities we create (providing another avenue of engagement for learners).  Here’s a visual of #PWYM musical tastes at a high level.This proved successful as a means of initial engagement: when the groups were announced, learners tried to “reverse engineer” the algorithm we’d developed – clearly grouping based on musical taste had piqued the interest of our community.Interested in how we implemented the Echonest API? Find our snappy documentation here: How We Used the Echonest API for Engagement and LearningWe think about these “learning ensembles” as affinity groups, as a means for groups to build a culture that they might belong to.In fact several groups went ahead and branded themselves. Check out the varied identities cohorts took on to form their own cultures:									From the G+ Community												From the G+ Community												From the G+ Community												From the G+ Community												From the G+ Community													From the G+ Community												From the G+ Community												From the G+ Community				FindingsAs previously mentioned, we thought of #PWYM as a design-based research project. Throughout the course, the PWYM team met virtually to discuss feedback from participants, making adjustments to content and course structure along the way. As the course wound down we began to crunch our datasets, including:      Email engagement within groups: number of times emails were opened, links clicked, replies to the group        Comments in the G+ community        Clicks on YouTube videos        Post-course survey (110 responses - 2% response rate as compared to sign-ups; 6.7% as compared to G+ group enrollment)  We started out with the hypotheses that our small cohorts would lead to sustained engagement. If our small groups enable learners to take risks and share, then their colleagues would buoy them up and help combat attrition (completion rates for traditional MOOCs hover around 7%). But as the course round down in week six, several surprising things happened.Stragglers still learn.What was surprising to us was that folks continued to post projects several weeks after the “deadlines” had passed. In the comments, folks mentioned that they had watched previous learners post their projects, and were inspired by them. Others apologized for the late post, like these folks who posted their projects a full 2 months later.Learners found their own crew.We noticed an interesting trend about halfway through the course. If a learner found that their cohort wasn’t active (or active enough) they would post their project to the wider #PWYM G+ community. From there, learners began to self-form into their own groups, often with folks who were at the same point in the learning material.Participation is a continuum.While a lot has been said about MOOC retention, we found that when we drilled down and got more granular, folks participated at different levels, in different ways, in different parts of the course. While many learners accessed the core content, others gave feedback, posted their own projects, or commented on the G+ site. Participation isn’t “on” or “off”–there are many points of entry and engagement.How important are credentials?We didn’t offer certificates of completion for this course, but we did feature 4 #PWYM Badges for folks to submit their projects. Of the 5,000+ folks who signed up and the relatively active 1, 500 folks in the G+ community, less than 50 learners applied for Badges. Researchers at EdX have  found that most learners who took their courses were not interested in the assessments,   and that certification is a “poor proxy for learning” in MOOCs (Ho 2014). Since this course was   aimed at an informal audience, it’s possible learners did not prioritize the credentials,    but instead valued the audience they gained on the G+ community and on SoundCloud.Expertise matters.While P2PU courses empower learners to create their own content, the input of experts matters as well. The weekly live interviews from industry experts empowered learners to engage directly with experts and received high praise from the community.  “The live interviews were amazing.”  “I did not expect so many quality guest speakers.”  “Very good course material (I’m particularly grateful to Alex Case). Also, I didn’t expect Brad Swanson to do a Soundation mix himself and explain his process in details. You made this mechanical MOOC very humane, with lots of input. And the whole approach of learning to listen before mixing was very helpful. Thank you very much.”The course that doesn’t end.In addition to our steady stream of stragglers, our post-course survey revealed that learners planned to keep going. Some learners liked specific tools, some were inspired to move their creative endeavors in a new direction, some wanted to try more advanced mixing programs. To wit:  “I learned more than I anticipated and prompted me to pursue additional online learning avenues such as Lynda.com”  “Lots of good pointers. Clearly explained instructions. Fun assignments. Love the SoundCloud and am going to contribute more in there.”  “My wife composes a lot of music, and I’m interested in producing a lot of that mixing synths and live instruments to make recordings of some of those compositions.”  “I would love to produce audio tracks to support video production work for my employer. These would be things like public service announcements (I work for the San Diego County District Attorney) and “feel good” videos about the work we do in the community. I’d also like to continue improving my ability to produce my own recorded tracks (singer and guitarist).”Expectations are high.The first P2PU courses were run on wikis—the open education landscape has changed a lot since then, and learners’ expectations for free courses are higher. Immediately after course launched, we found a bug that gummed up our ability to send emails from the Mechanical MOOC. Even though we had messaged our course as experimental, and frequently posted tech support updates,  the learners were restless. Unfortunately this bug may have contributed to attrition early on in  the course. Lesson here: troubleshoot, brand your experience as an “Alpha” and have a direct   way for learners to file bug reports.Google+ please give us your data.We loved using Google+. Many learners already had profiles, and they would receive timely notifications from the #PWYM community. However, Google doesn’t currently have an API for G+, so we were unable to access this engagement data. We’d love to see Google enable Community Statistics for non-profits moving forward. Please, Google?DiscussionThis was P2PU’s first foray into the “creative expression” space, and we learned a lot from it. Additionally our findings and experiences have implications for the wider MOOC and online learning landscape. As the EdX folks have noted, MOOCs are a different beast, and the definition of “student” or a “course” might need to be rethought in this context. We agree, and put another few terms up for discussion.Retention.As we could see from the stragglers and ongoing G+ activity, #PWYM’s momentum didn’t stop after the course officially “ended.” Latecomers paid attention to what the initial learners posted, took inspiration from them, and continued to work on projects in their own time. In this light, retention is longitudinal. Or put another way, courses are a way to introduce new people to a wider, ongoing community. Courses don’t need to stop, nor should they—mentors can help newbies who are struggling in the first weeks of the course.Assessment.We’ve discussed at length how we think assessment should work like the web, but #PWYM added another dimension to the discussion. After we grouped cohorts together, learners sought expertise and camaraderie outside their small group. In a social learning environment, finding “your people” is a way of successfully navigating the community. We suggest that finding your “crew” or your cohort is a kind of assessment. Knowing who has the expertise  you are looking for is as important as having the right question.Cohorts.As we mentioned, we were really excited by the idea of building affinity groups when we grouped folks by musical taste. Our hope was that, by building small communities, we would help groups develop a feeling of belonging. However, that engagement, for most groups, was short-lived. Small groups may have grounded folks in the #PWYM community initially, but they needed a reason to build and own their culture. In the future, we suggest designing a balance of structure and serendipity in an online learning community. We’ll also be paying attention to when learners begin to use the language “we” and “our.” And six weeks might not be enough time for a group to gel.Community.Thinking through how to bootstrap, nurture, and maintain a community is vital in a MOOC. We’re really proud of the feedback we received about the #PWYM community:  “I wasn’t sure what I would really learn, but this course offered great material, in a great format, with the aid of a fantastic community.”  “I was amazed how helpful the PWYM community was to each other.”  “i met different people of different cultures and musical tastes but had 1 thing in common….music and production didn’t really know what to expect in the first place”We seeded our community pages with sample content, modeled a reflective practice, and encouraged people to share their sounds with others. Especially in an online context, learning is inherently social. We advise future MOOCs to consider how the community will interact as their first design principle.We’re really pleased with the outcome of the course. If success in open learning is building a vibrant community of practice, with learners who will continue to imagine new ways to deploy the skills they’ve learned, then we’ve achieved it. We’re also excited about our results and their  ramifications for online learning in the future–project-based, creative,  but above all rooted in community.What’s Next for #PWYM?PWYM 2.0 is a nifty collaboration with renowned rock star Peter Gabriel. Many of the core projects and experiences will be the same, however, we will be focusing on creative music and audio production skills using the music of Peter Gabriel. In addition to assisting you in analyzing and making your own music, we’ll augment the class with interviews from musicians who’ve performed and collaborated with Peter in the past. So we believe experienced PWYM participants will have a chance to make new connections and go deeper–and help others along the way. #PWYM 2.0 begins May 16, 2014.

	"title": "Rethinking Assessment, Supporting Diversity",
	"text": "IntroductionThis piece originally appeared in the online magazine Educating Modern Learners in May 2014    Despite all the promises of the World Wide Web as a platform for online learning, there are still many questions about whether or not we are building learning tools and learning communities that welcome and support a diversity of ideas and people. How do stereotypes affect the ways in which technologies are developed and implemented? Here, P2PU Learning Lead Vanessa Gennarelli argues that we must take what we know about gender and performance in order to design assessments that open rather than close opportunities.  Audrey Watters  Nearly 25 years ago, Sherry Turkle and Seymour Papert offered us another way to recognize how people learn. Their seminal piece “Epistemological Pluralism” walked through how different kinds of thinkers—artists, poets, musicians—would pick up pieces of  programming knowledge, map these slices to things they already knew (like blank verse) and   assemble their own novel creations. Unlike a linear approach to programming,   which may appeal to learners who are predominantly male, Turkle and Papert encouraged us to   consider a “bricoleur” style: learning by association, discussion with the materials,   watching interactions and iterating upon them.As educators, we have not delivered on their vision.At Peer 2 Peer University we’ve thought extensively on the current state (and future of) assessment on the web. This piece will look at assessment  and gender, specifically in terms of assignment types, interfaces, and priming. We’ll critique  a few examples of current assessment practices and trends in online learning. From there,  we’ll recommend a path to the future of assessment that is diverse, inclusive,  and recognizes multiple paths to the “answer.” Because that is the goal of innovation in this  space. Not making assessment more manageable. Or necessarily easier. The goal is to nurture a  creative society of engaged citizens who think uniquely and engage collaboratively.If we hold on to competition and multiple choice, we surrender our chances at that goal.Gender, Performance and Mental ModelsIn situations of cognitive stress, such as a programming exercise or a math test, women and girls may experience pressure to overcome traits associated with their gender. This anxiety, commonly called stereotype threat, can inhibit the performance of those in the minority group (Steele, Spencer &amp; Aronson, 2002). If you’re female and have ever walked into a room of  all males to give a technical talk, you’re probably familiar with the sensation.We want learners to perform at the best level of their ability. So, let’s see how stereotype threat appears in assessment and web tools, and from there discuss what we can do about it. We’ll start with how priming affects our thinking.Priming refers to a set of expectations and stereotypes you might carry out about your social group, often unbeknownst to you. For instance, if you’re elderly and your age is suggested, you might start to act in keeping with those expectations. It’s a sinister beast.Researchers Jennifer Steele and Nalini Ambady found that even checking a box with your gender before a test can hamper performance (2006). Let’s reflect on that for a moment. Almost every survey you’ve ever taken and every sign-up form has this question—and it has a chilling effect on performance.Let’s take a step back to think about priming in the context of the the ed-tech landscape. How many educational tools in the Apple Store are marketed specifically at girls? How about gender questions in signup forms?One way to stem stereotype threat is to give female learners a sense that they aren’t alone. Michael Inzlicht and Talia Ben-Zeev found that the ratio of males to females in a classroom may also trigger stereotype threat (2000). Further, a more masculine or traditionally “geeky” environment can have similarly negative effects (Cheryan et al., 2009).I’ve been impressed with products and platforms that pay mind to issues of priming and gender. One of those is DIY.org, a project-based learning platform for kids. DIY.org is an umbrella for smaller subcommunities, like botany and beekeeping. In the sign-up flow, a user is prompted to select from a gallery of mostly gender-neutral avatars.DIY.org is an example of using smarter defaults to bolster performance. And in online environments, the interfaces go a long way towards prompting interactions and feedback amongst learners.The Interface is the MessageA few months ago I came across David A. Bank’s stellar article “Very Serious Populists” in the New Inquiry. In deconstructing the interfaces of various online communities, he pointed the graphic on the right:Take note of the platforms on the top and the bottom of the graph. Pinterest, Goodreads, Tumblr, and Twitter feature interface gestures of support and quality via sharing: repinning, retweeting, reblogging. Reddit, Stack Overflow and Hacker News feature interface gestures of competition:  “up voting” and “down voting.”It’s nearly impossible to separate content from platform (Pinterest with its bevy of food photography and Stack Overflow with its wealth of technical information appeal to different audiences) or to prove causation. Nonetheless a curious trend exists amongst this user data. Does a competitive interface alienate women?If we look to the research on gender and competition, the answer is a resounding yes—and the findings are sobering. Muriel Niederle and Lise Vesterlund found that men are twice as likely to enter a tournament as women (2007). So before females even get into the room at a competition,  men are more likely to outnumber them. Even the most talented women are reluctant—Niederle and  Vesterlund found that women in the highest-performing quartile were less likely to enter than  men in the lowest-performing quartile.Scholarship in this area is nascent, and Niederle and Vesterlund’s paper is recent. But the research on whether competition is effective at all is well-documented. Alfie Kohn’s recent book No Contest points to a meta-analysis of 128 studies on competition versus cooperation from 1924 to 1980 (Johnson, date needed). Amongst the findings: “65 studies found that cooperation promotes higher achievement than competition, 8 found the reverse, and 36 found no statistically significant difference.”Even if competition possibly alienates women, it doesn’t produce better results for anyone.If we look at the education landscape, we can see evidently that “gamification” has taken hold. While it’s entirely possible to design cooperative games—I look to alternate reality games in particular—in the ed-tech world, competition has become commonplace. Points, leaderboards and winning are frequently used to spark engagement (how does one win at learning?).But how do we assess cooperative learning and collaboration? How do we create interfaces that nurture networked learning?I recommend the following design principles:  Cooperation-based user interfaces—sharing, favoriting, trees of influence  Smarter defaults—gender-neutral prompts, language and imagery, invitations to participate  Project-based assessments—rubrics, portfolios, mechanisms that focus on qualitative feedbackCooperation-Based InterfacesThe Scratch team at the MIT Media Lab holds collaboration as a core tenet for their platform. As young “Scratchers” create their own design projects, they are encouraged to share them with the community for feedback. Many of Scratch’s design choices nurture cooperation, among them “remix trees” which show how many Scratchers have used a project for inspiration.These trees show how projects are interconnected. Students’ projects are never 100% “theirs”–they always possess the potential to be adapted and built upon, and stand upon the shoulders of  something else.  Making reusable projects is an important 21st century skill–remixing trees  “measure” that impact.In the Peer 2 Peer University community, Dave Cormier recently launched the “Rhizomatic Learning: The Community is the Curriculum”  course. Cormier challenged learners to create their learning paths together by connecting to  each other. In order to “measure” the connectedness of the community,  he used Martin Hawksey’s TAGSExplorer tool to visualize their network at a high level.From there, Cormier prompted learners to see singletons in the community network and reach out to them. Collaboration and cooperation was baked into the course structure. Learners could see the  impact they were having on the community, in real time, as their knowledge network grew.But the interface itself is only one part of the equation—the other is crafting assignments to produce diverse ideas. Let’s take a look at the kinds of online assignments that would suit.Assignments that BindFocus on themes. Instead of encouraging learners to compete to solve a problem, select a thematic focus for a project (Resnick 2013). Organizations like StoryHackcreate thematic “hackathons” where folks come together around certain ideas or riff on a site for inspiration. Instead of working deductively towards a “correct” solution,  learners are free to follow their personal passions. In a more formal setting,  the Science Leadership Academy in Philadelphia anchors each  year with a theme: identity, systems, change and creation. The assignments map onto those   themes which prompt learners to create their own understanding of the concepts.Highlight diverse examples. Showcasing a range of work inspires learners to imagine what’s possible (as opposed to what’s correct). At the same time, an array of different projects models inclusivity, builds a broad community of learners. For instance, the homepage for the 3-D printing community Shapeways features projects that range from an egg-cup to accessories to bling out your Google Glass.Use remixing as an assignment. Starting with a piece of music, art, poetry or code and prompting learners to remix offers an infinite number of interpretations on one original piece. For P2PU’s  recent Play With Your Music project, hundreds of folks remixed their own version of “Air   Traffic Control” by Clara Barry. We saw everything from trip hop to echoey reverb. At the same   time, since the learners had spent so much time with the original piece,    they were able to critique the subtle departures their various peers made.Studio critique is a method we’re excited to see in the future of online learning. While calibrated peer review (review 5 other people, then review yourself) is an idea that’s been around for awhile, only recently has collaborative video been so easy. Peers reviewing each other—in real time and in their own voices—imparts agency to each learner in the group. Google help-outs are already edging in this direction, and I can’t wait to see more.You’ll notice that these assignments are open-ended, subjective, creative and equalizing. The assessments (rubrics, badges, or reviews, for example) should be as well.What’s At StakeAt this juncture, large-scale MOOCs and e-learning platforms boast “personalized learning experiences” While self-study and empowerment are admirable goals, usually “personalized” means a student working alone on problem sets (even if those problem sets are specifically designed for them). The danger is that online learning will become a sea of student silos, all in search of the right answer.But real-life problems often have dozens of potential solutions. As long as there is one right answer, we’re competing for a scarce amount of knowledge. Though it is tricky, we must build assignments and interfaces that recognize an array of projects. If we recognize many paths to the answer, we’re cultivating a diversity of ideas and people. Or, put another way, pluralism.Works Cited:Banks, D. (2013, December 20). Very Serious Populists.

	"title": "Learning Creative Learning: How we tinkered with MOOCs",
	"text": "IntroductionIn the spring of 2013, everyone was talking about Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Startup companies like Coursera and Udacity were offering free courses from distinguished professors. MIT and Harvard joined forces to create EdX. Everyone was promising a revolution in education, in which high-quality learning experiences would be available to anyone with a computer and Internet connection, anywhere in the world, from Boston to Bogota to Bangalore. We were skeptical. We certainly recognized that MOOCs could play a role in the educational ecosystem. Watching a video lecture by a university professor can be an interesting and rewarding experience. But we doubted whether MOOCs, at least in their current form, could support the types of learning experiences that we felt were most valuable. We worried that MOOCs were focusing too much on delivering content to students – and not enough on engaging students in creative and collaborative learning experiences.Instead of simply complaining about MOOCs, we decided to create our own. Our goal was to create an online course more aligned with our own educational sensibilities and style. We were not opposed to “massive” but it was not our first priority. Could we bring our interest-driven, project-based, peer-oriented learning approach to the world of MOOCs?In developing the course, we brought together expertise and experience from two different organizations. Mitch and Natalie are researchers in the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab, where they develop new technologies and activities to engage children in creative learning experiences. Philipp is co-founder of Peer-to-Peer University (P2PU), a grassroots open-education project that designs and organizes online learning experiences, with special focus on people learning with and from one another.When Philipp came to the Media Lab in 2012 as a visiting fellow, the three of us decided to join forces to experiment with MOOCs. In particular, we decided to create an online version of a course called Technologies for Creative Learning, which Mitch had been teaching at MIT over the past decade. The course had been organized as a project-based seminar. Throughout the semester, students worked together in small groups, designing technologies and activities to engage people in creative learning experiences. During the weekly meeting of the class, students discussed readings and provided feedback on one another’s projects. The course typically attracted about 25 graduate students each year, mostly from the MIT Media Lab and the Harvard Graduate School of Education. For the spring 2013 semester, we decided to open up the course so that people around the world could participate online for free (with no credit or certification), in parallel with the in-person course at MIT (where students were receiving academic credit). Our goal was to engage more people in exploring and discussing ideas related to creative learning, so we renamed the course “Learning Creative Learning.” In a recursive twist, we wanted the course itself to be a model of creative learning, so that course participants would be experiencing the creative-learning process at the same time that they were learning about it.At first, Natalie expressed hesitation about whether the online experience would work well, and if we could preserve the hands-on character of the Media Lab course in the online environment, but she agreed to join the design and planning. Philipp worked with the P2PU team to create a playful and inviting website which clearly stated that the course was “a big experiment.” We sent out some tweets and emails about the course, but had no idea what type of response to expect. Word about the course spread rapidly, as the announcement was picked up by a few prominent blogs and websites. Within a week, about 25,000 people had registered to participate. In the end, about 10,000 people joined the discussion forum for the course, and a few thousand people actively contributed. We were happy that so many people were interested, and particularly pleased at the diversity of the participants – including not only educators (which we expected), but also parents, librarians, designers, lawyers, and technologists from around the world. At the same time, we were worried. Could we provide a meaningful learning experience to such a large group of people? A Big ExperimentRight from the outset, our mantra was: This is an experiment, and we invite everyone to experiment with us. This approach was consistent with ideas highlighted in the course itself. One underlying theme throughout the course is the importance of iterative experimentation, or tinkering, in the learning process. So it was natural for us to explore the possibilities of MOOCs by experimenting and tinkering.By framing the course as a prototype, rather than a final product, we were able to manage our own expectations as well as those of the participants. Anxieties around how to facilitate or interact with so many people gave way to cautiously optimistic excitement when many of the participants told us that the experimental aspect was their favorite part of the experience.Framing the course as an experiment did not mean that we skipped on careful planning and preparation. We had long conversations to tease out the challenges of opening up a Media Lab course. And some of the things that Philipp in particular felt excited about – like how to enable lots of people to participate, or how to provide lots of freedom to the learners themselves – also helped us identify which aspects of the course we wanted keep more control of. We didn’t just want to throw the doors open to see what would happen. Letting people know right from the outset that we didn’t have all the answers meant that whenever technical hitches came up, as they invariably did, participants responded to each other by saying “Remember, they said from the start that this was a prototype,” which allowed the community to have a sense of ownership over the experiment, including its successes and its failures.	Course Design and TechnologyWhen designing the course structure, we emphasized learning through projects and learning with peers – in part because those learning approaches were central to the traditional in-person version of the course at the Media Lab, but also because those approaches tend to be under-represented (and under-valued) in large online courses. We constantly explored ways of making the course more participatory. Each week we introduced a learning activity, such as “create a Scratch project and share it with others” or “explore a physical learning venue in your community”. Learners actively experienced different aspects of creative learning, rather than being asked to read about them. We also encouraged participants to give feedback to each other and collaborate on projects. In another departure from the typical MOOC model, we decided to host a weekly live event, with video streamed from a lecture room at MIT. Online participants could not only “watch” the seminar, but also participate in a back-channel chat system we had developed (as an open-source platform). We tried to connect the discussions in the classroom with those of the online community, but this proved to be challenging. We also learned that doing something “live” can be stressful, because so much can (and will) go wrong with technology, and it can be distracting for the speaker to navigate the local and the virtual audiences at the same time. Our platform was the web. While many MOOC projects spend a great deal of time and money developing new platforms, we decided to take a different approach. We wanted to create a model that is easy for anyone to replicate, so we used off-the-shelf tools, like Google Hangouts and open-source software like the Mechanical MOOC, which manages sign-ups and makes it easy to automate weekly course emails.  Our goal was to show that it is not that hard to build a course like this,  and that you do not need a lot of money to do it. For the live seminars, we used Google Hangouts on Air, which provides streaming and archiving. We chose Google+ communities as the core platform for discussions and sharing, because of the large number of participants (at one point, our Learning Creative Learning community was one of the 100 largest G+ communities) and because G+ communities integrates well with G+ Hangouts.We also experimented with ways to form smaller groups. Large community spaces are great to feel a sense of activity and excitement, to get fast replies (because someone is always online), and to get a broad diversity of opinions and ideas. But it is also easy to feel lost in the crowd. Working in smaller groups makes it easier to develop deep relationships with other learners, feel invested in each other’s work, and provide ongoing support and encouragement. We automatically created email lists of 40 people, based on time zones. We also encouraged participants to start their own groups. We were excited to see more than 450 groups form, some based around location, others based around interests. It is fair to say that the automatic grouping did not work as well as we had hoped. Most email groups floundered after initial excitement and a flurry of introduction emails. We identified several reasons for this: participants often received more immediate feedback in the larger G+ forum than in the subgroup; members within the subgroup often did not find common interests and preferred to communicate with other participants in the community; and we did not make a strong effort to tie group collaboration into the activities of the course. Our survey results confirmed that most participants felt their groups did not work. At the same time, almost everyone who filled out the survey encouraged us to try again and get better at grouping – because they saw the potential of small groups for knowledge sharing, networking, and support. One group that did thrive developed a group identity, initiated intercontinental collaborations, and took leadership roles in the course the following year. Collaborators over RecipientsFrom the beginning, we hoped to engage students in the design of the course itself. Rather than designing the course to provide a uniform experience for every student, we designed structures in which the participants could participate in different ways, using the tools they are comfortable with. And we encouraged participants to share tools and activities with one another: we were interested to see what new practices would emerge if we invited thousands of co-learners to experiment with us. During the first days of the course, a participant from Italy posted that he would like to see a global map of all the people who had joined. We were excited about that idea and enthusiastically agreed and suggested he create one. And so Adriano Parraciani became the creator and steward of a map of participants. He answered technical questions and helped others add their pins to the map. And there were many other examples of participants becoming collaborators: Julie Donders and Corinne Thomson created beautiful illustrations to summarize what we discussed in our live seminars, and Simon Fogg created PDF files to combine each week’s articles into a format that was easier to download to ebook readers.We considered the participants as our collaborators, rather than recipients of content we had created, because it signaled that they had ownership and agency. There was also a second more pragmatic reason. It is very difficult to scale meaningful learning and we needed the participants to take initiative and support each other, rather than wait for the “experts” to provide feedback and instruction. In small classrooms, we can facilitate the conversations and spend time with each student individually. At scale, that is simply not possible.At a certain point, we realized that there was no way we could be the facilitators for that many people. Rather than telling groups which tools to use, or suggesting how to assign moderators, we let things emerge. We had to let go at a certain point to really understand what peer-to-peer learning was. Our own role changed and became more focused on highlighting and supporting the people who were adding tools and expanding the way the course worked. Conversations over PresentationsToo often, people think about education in terms of “delivery” or “transmission” of information. Many MOOCs are based on this metaphor, focusing on presentations of information, usually in the form of video-based lectures from academic experts. In developing Learning Creative Learning, we were determined to avoid this presentation-based approach. Our goal was to focus on conversations over presentations. These conversations took on several different forms. In each of our weekly sessions, we organized a conversation on issues related to the theme-of-the-week. When the theme was “Interest-Based Learning”, for example, Mitch moderated a conversation with the brother-sister duo of Joi Ito (director of the Media Lab) and Mimi Ito (cultural anthropologist at University of California at Irvine), asking them to reflect on their own learning trajectories – and how their experiences had been guided by their interests and passions. When the theme was “Constructionism and Making”, Mitch moderated a conversation with Dale Dougherty (publisher and editor of MAKE magazine) and Leah Buechley (a pioneer in e-textiles design and research), sparking a discussion about the relationship between making and learning. But these conversations were not necessarily the most important conversations taking place. We arranged a “backchannel” that enabled participants in the course to chat with one another during the webcast conversation. We were delighted by the level of activity and engagement in the back channel – and, clearly, so were the participants. As one participant wrote in the G+ discussion forum: “I think I enjoy the chat more than listening to the talk.” And another participant wrote: “I’ll have to watch the video again. I was so intrigued by the backchannel I paid more attention to this conversation.” As facilitators, we often regretted that we weren’t able to pay more attention to (and participate in) the backchannel conversation, since we were busy talking with the invited experts. Projects over Problem SetsA key aspect of the Media Lab learning philosophy is that people learn best when working on projects that they find personally meaningful. In our Lifelong Kindergarten research group, we often offer face-to-face workshops in which educators or youth collaboratively create interactive stories, robotic inventions, or a wide range of other design projects. Rather than presenting them with problems to solve, we encourage them to create projects related to their interests – and, in the process, they learn to solve problems that arise in a context they find personally relevant.For us, one of the big challenges in developing an online course was figuring out ways to support project-based activities with so many participants scattered in remote locations. For the first week of the course, we suggested an introductory design activity for small groups to build a structure out of spaghetti, with a marshmallow on top (based on the Marshmallow Challenge). We were not sure if participants online would make the effort to organize the materials and groups locally. So we were thrilled when participants in the course began sharing photos and stories of their own experiences with the activity. The discussion forum was filled with images of spaghetti-marshmallow structures from Spain, Ethiopia, and elsewhere around the world.We made sure to engage participants in questions that could immediately establish personally meaningful connections, such as asking them, “What is an object from your childhood that interested and influenced you?” Participants from around the world shared rich descriptions, photos, and drawings of meaningful objects from their childhood. For example, Jeff Rudell described how he had carefully crafted a toy typewriter out an egg carton when he was a boy, reflecting an early interest that he continues in his career as a designer today. Seeing the connections participants around the world made as they shared reflections on their childhood experiences was the turning point that convinced Natalie of the potential of the online course to support new possibilities for creative learning. Because participants could apply the questions and activities to their own lives – and immediately share the results – the community was dynamic and active. Whenever you checked the Google+ site, you could see new pictures that had been uploaded, with participants sharing experiences, such as, “I went out and tried this activity with people in my neighborhood, and here’s what we created.” At the beginning of each of the video sessions, we highlighted examples of what online participants had been sharing the previous week. The sharing of examples from participants became a favorite aspect of the live sessions. Community over CourseWhat started as an online course, slowly evolved into a community. It would be easy to say now that this was our intention from the start, but the truth is, we were a little surprised ourselves – surprised and excited. The online course became a springboard for learning with family, friends, and colleagues. At one point, the whole idea of “us” (the supposed experts) teaching “them” went out of the window. Not only did the participants learn a lot from each other, we learned from participants too. For example, during the week on “Learning in Communities,” participants went out to visit physical learning spaces and reported back on what they found. We enjoyed reading about all the interesting places and models for learning from all over the world. Heloisa Zal, a participant from Brazil, described how youth are revitalizing the use of public spaces by organizing open learning, social, cultural, and political events. Graciela Arizmendi organized an open creative learning day for children and families in her town in Mexico. Another activity asked participants to develop a computer program in the Scratch programming environment. One participant, Cecilia Trevino, turned to her daughter when she needed help: “I found this activity challenging and I asked help from my daughter.” Parents learned from their children and together they were able to create and share projects with the online community. The difference between a typical online course and a learning community was felt particularly strongly during the week after the Boston Marathon Bombings. MIT was locked down for a few hours, nobody was allowed to leave the Media Lab building, and anxiety levels in the city and on campus were high. We felt overwhelmed by the supportive messages that poured in from the online community, from people all around the world. Learning Creative Learning had evolved from a course to a community of people who took an interest, not only in one another’s learning, but in one another’s lives.After the course officially ended, the community continued, defying the standard MOOC model. At education conferences throughout the year, Learning Creative Learning participants have been meeting up face-to-face, to extend and deepen the relationships that started online. After almost every presentation that we give these days, someone will come up afterwards and tell us that they took the course. After speaking at a conference in Berlin, Philipp learned about a group of eight local participants who had never met before the course but were still in touch with each other months after the course had ended. Mitch even got interrupted in the gym once, by someone who placed a piece of paper on top of the treadmill while Mitch was exercising. The paper said simply: “Thank you for Learning Creative Learning.”The Future of Creative Learning OnlineOffering Learning Creative Learning as an online course for thousands of participants took a lot of effort. When the course ended, we all felt we needed a break. But during the next few months we kept reflecting on the experience and thinking of changes we would make if we ran it again. Then, in spring 2014 we did run it again – and we continued to experiment. In the first iteration of the course, we had felt constrained by offering the online version simultaneously with the official course at MIT. So we decided to offer only the online version in spring 2014. Freed from the semester-length timetable for university courses, we made the online version shorter and experimented with other changes in the format.We designed a number of core modules that could be taken in any order. These modules introduced four principal ideas of our creative learning framework: projects, peers, passion, and play. We also added a class project, called Reimagine Education, at the end. One of the challenges we noticed in the first iteration of the course was that educators were struggling to apply the ideas of creative learning within the rigid structures they faced within their schools. We wanted to shine the light on successful examples of how this integration could be done and encourage participants to start collaborating beyond the course.We also kept experimenting with different formats for the weekly live event, hosting the sessions on Philipp’s new Unhangout platform, which supports embedding videos and chat as well as break-out rooms. In 2013, streaming live was exciting, but it was also stressful and introduced a lot of technical challenges that were distracting from the content. In 2014, we retained the conversational format of many of the seminars, but pre-recorded them and then “watched” them together with the course participants. This allowed us to preserve the excitement of a live event, and at the same time enabled us to participate in the backchannel discussions. We also added live breakout conversations, in which participants gathered in virtual rooms, with up to ten people per room, typically for 10-15 minutes. These breakouts received very positive feedback in the course evaluation. We were happy to see that participants still value the possibility of speaking with one another over listening to us.In 2013, the public conversation about online learning was dominated by broadcast-oriented MOOCs, focused on streaming video lectures. Since then, we have been happy to see many examples for other formats emerge, like the Connected Learning MOOC or the Deeper Learning MOOC. Some of them were directly inspired by Learning Creative Learning, or used tools we developed; others are part of a new wave of experimentation. Between 2013 and 2014, we made many changes to the technology and the course structure, but we stuck to our core design principles and the goal to support creative learning online. There is now a growing awareness that broadcasting short video content to larger numbers of people misses the things that are most important for learners: working on projects that they are passionate about, in collaboration with peers, within a playful environment that encourages experimentation. Learning Creative Learning was our first attempt at supporting this kind of learning online and at scale. We’ve learned a lot from the experience, but there is still much more to be learned.Want To Learn More?A lot of the learning, interactions, and materials from Learning Creative Learning are online and free to use. If you want an overview of the course, to get a rough idea of what we did, take a look at the course home page (http://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl), where you can also find links to the course materials.

	"title": "Writing 4 Change",
	"text": "IntroductionAuthored by: Bekka Kahn, Tyler Benjamin, Vanessa GennarelliOne of our most exciting collaborative learning experiments in 2014 was a project called Writing For Change. In partnership with College Unbound, we wanted to see what would happen when we tried to replicate the unique stickiness of face-to-face learning in groups. College Unbound, in Providence, Rhode Island, is a nonprofit which provides pathways to an accredited bachelor’s degrees granted by partnering colleges or universities. CU targets learners who began a degree program, but were unable to finish. Their curricula are flexible and personalized around the unique skills, knowledge, and needs of individuals. Coursework revolves around a professional or personal project that is designed and implemented by the student. Often these projects are community and systems oriented. The CU curriculum is designed to have its own integrity, shaped around a specific population, relevant to the student, the times, and the economy.  P2PU is an online Open Ed non-profit, which builds online learning communities on the Web. CU and P2PU have long admired each other from afar - our working philosophies of community support and self-directed learning are complementary and what CU does in face-to-face experiences is what P2PU has long tried to replicate online. This year, we decided to collaborate to create Writing for Change, a free course to help learners develop their writing skills in order to enact social change.CU + P2PU = ?College Unbound has always struggled with the limitations of traditional online learning ecosystems - in their experience, traditional tools which simply deliver content were unappealing and actually ended up restricting the potential for people to tell their stories or find a community for support, collaboration and sharing. The result was that online component of learning became a chore, instead of a tool for opening up new possibilities.  What College Unbound was looking for was an online experience that could match their in-person goals, and replicate the inspirational messiness of face-to-face learning experiences which CU cultivates for their students. The project needed to capture, reflect and expand on the College Unbound principle of transformational learning, and help learners develop a project of their designing which valued their previous experience, and respected and incorporated their other current full-time obligations.P2PU, on the other hand, has worked hard over the years to develop online learning spaces that are as flexible, emergent and networked as possible. Through a potent mix of community, technology and learning design, we’ve tried to replicate the support, humour and serendipity that is found in face-to-face learning groups and scale it up for learning on the Web. However, we started to notice that much of our audience is drawn from a small sub-section of people who use the Web. This group tends to skew towards learners who are technologically savvy, comfortable with online behavioural norms and tools, early adopters, and who learn because they want to, rather than because they have to. They are great people to work with, but we’ve known for a while that if P2PU is to make a real change in the way people all over the world use the Web for learning, we’d need to find a way to reach many other different types of learners. These learners are often overlooked within EdTech conversations.So when it came to the time for P2PU to run a writing course as one of the deliverables of our grant from the Hewlett Foundation, we thought long and hard about what kind of course we wanted to run, and who we wanted to run it with. Who could a writing course most benefit? What kind of writing would be appropriate for the learners we wanted to attract? Rather than simply provide a space for people who were already writers, it made sense to us to develop a course for people who were thinking about working on their writing skills. We decided to create a writing course that was an online version of a studio - to help folks become better writers in the service of what learners wanted to accomplish.

Course DesignAt P2PU we try to bake the possibility for synchronous and asynchronous learning into all of our experiments. Writing for Change was no different - the College Unbound groups worked through the course in face-to-face groups on campus, while other participants from places as diverse as Kenya and Mexico City were able to move through the content at their own pace. The content of the course was designed around eight modules, each of which investigated different aspects of building community projects. Learners worked through topics which included identifying issues they felt strongly about, researching background information on the problem, looking at how other writers found their voices and learning how to give valuable and thorough feedback. Each module had question, resource and activity components, and each module’s reading was designed to prompt thinking about the questions in preparation for the writing activity. These modules were supplemented by using Discourse, a forum-like tool, where each week online and offline learners were prompted to discuss the topic, share thoughts and ideas and post as many animal gifs as they could find:The modules were designed to meet several goals - firstly to help develop the writing skills of all participants, but also to meet the learning goals of the participants, and of P2PU and College Unbound. We made sure there was enough flexibility in design to make sure that if certain aspects were not working, adjustments could be made. The course was also designed to help both P2PU and College Unbound to test some of our hypotheses about learning, both online and offline. We’ve been interested for a long time in the role of communities and cohorts in online learning. Firstly, we wanted to find out how to build a sense of belonging in non-traditional learners. We also wanted to find out how a sense of belonging to a defined community might help improve the learning experience, and, finally, whether those communities work better when grouped around shared interests or by other criteria. We’d tested some of these hypotheses in our music remix course, but we wanted to be sure.We ran a pre-course survey, which provided a rich data set to get started with, and helped us develop a sense of the community we were working with. However, as the course evolved, we found that it was the College Unbound crew who formed the core of the cohort, rather than the people who filled in the survey. This implies that there is an evolution of the cohort over the duration of a hybrid online/offline course as some people drop out and others loop back in. It may also mean that for learners who are taking this class for credit toward degrees, the motivation to “do the work” is focussed on aspects which, in their eyes, are directly connected to them earning credit. Completing a survey may not be a priority because taking surveys and surveys themselves are not considered grade-worthy in many of the institutions and systems that learners have known in the past. Lesson # 1: Find What Matters to the LearnerOne of the first tasks all learners had to complete was to introduce themselves and share what issues they felt most strongly about. The range of responses and breadth of topics was truly inspiring, with topics covering urban gardening, African American history, using education for social change and the Labour movement. It became clear quite early on that the stakes for many of the participants in this course were very high. We also realised that while many participants were based in far-flung places, for the College Unbound cohort, their sense of community is deeply rooted in place and the people in their immediate community. This was a first for P2PU, and really helped us to think deeply about how to ensure the course was relevant and useful to a less-dispersed community.Lesson #2: Break Your AssumptionsWe also realised really early on that our assumptions about how learners were using technology were completely wrong. The College Unbound crew were different to anyone we had worked with before, and did not have the same relationship with technology that most P2PU learners had. Tools like Unhangouts, Google docs and forums were simply not as relevant in their lives, and assuming familiarity with these tools risked making learners feel alienated. For time-poor students, the commitment required to tinker with new tools and develop fluency was a curiosity-killer. In order to keep the course relevant, we quickly adapted the technological component of the course, and started using many more face-to-face meetings and even sent Vanessa to Providence to work with the team there. However, the goal of the course, to serve as an avenue toward a bachelor’s degree that is relevant for students seeking an “unbound” college experience meant tapping into the nearly boundless potential of online communities. As a necessity, then, part of that experience had to include exploring online identities. This highlighted the disconnect between those who design educational technology products, and the people who use them, and surfaced several key facts:   Messaging around openness may be familiar to those who work in Open Ed, but it does not always match up with informal learning landscape.     Terminology can be a hindrance, as well as a tool.    For a community like College Unbound learners, online spaces will always be secondary to offline and face-to-face interactions.     It takes time to unlearn the restrictions of commercial online content tools.    Hoping that learners will be comfortable enough to abandon the ingrained rhetoric of “the right way vs the wrong way” is a big ask. It may take a while for this to happen. You might lose some people along the way.    At the same time, the freedom of more open tools can be intimidating, and learners often need initial guidance to help them master the space and feel at ease.  Lesson #3 Then You Can Start BuildingAt the time of writing the course is in the final stages, and we’ve asked learners to take a post-course survey in order to find out what has changed for them since Writing for Change launched. We don’t yet know what we’re going to find, but what we do know is that some of the learners are beginning to have an impact on their community through their writing, which is exactly what we had hoped:   “I honestly sat back and struggled with what could be considered an artifact for a non-profit barbershop. So I walked into the space that I used for this project and I saw it and it hit me like a ton of bricks….I thought it be a good idea to showcase some of the haircuts and the different styles me and my partner at the time did. The artifact part would actually not be the pictures of the haircuts but the smiles of the faces on the kids who received these cuts. Creating a space not only where positive conversation can happen but also a place where a community could be built. Instilling with this young men the importance of community and the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would do just that.” - Jose Rodriguez, participant.ConclusionsThis week @CollegeUnbound taught me about accomplishing real social change through community. Thank you. pic.twitter.com/rsIDpyPBiQ&mdash; Vanessa Gennarelli (@mozzadrella) October 1, 2014We have emerged from Writing for Change having learnt more than we ever thought we would. These are our biggest takeaways, and we’ll be putting them into practice soon:Unlearning - it’s not enough to expect learners to know how to work openly. A lot of work needs to be done to unlearn the one-way-to-do-things-right model which many learners take with them from school into the online learning space. This binary model is reinforced by many of the ubiquitous online learning tools, which are exclusionary, and keep people out. Helping learners leave that behind is a critical first step. At the same time, any replacement tools and platforms need to be able to both keep unhelpful people out, and be open enough to keep awesome people in. “Open” is  difficult to explain - Terminology can make things harder sometimes. “Open” is one of those terms, and for learners who have come out of the binary model, the idea of openness can be tricky. It’s important to think about when some terminology is useful, and when it might be better to frame things differently. Online second to the offline - For non-traditional learners, the community is essential. Not just for learning, but also for daily life. The challenges in designing learning experiments is to find ways to replicate the value of communities in the online space, and make sure that offline communities can transition online with ease. ",
